9jf8nh,-,announcements,7519,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",2018-09-27 18:11:58,1600,"While Reddit has had a [quarantine](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/quarantined-subreddits) function for almost three years now, we have learned in the process. Today, we are updating our quarantining policy to reflect those learnings, including adding an appeals process where none existed before.  

On a platform as open and diverse as Reddit, there will sometimes be communities that, while not prohibited by the [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy), average redditors may nevertheless find highly offensive or upsetting. In other cases, communities may be dedicated to promoting hoaxes (yes we used that word) that warrant additional scrutiny, as there are some things that are either verifiable or falsifiable and not seriously up for debate (eg, the Holocaust did happen and the number of people who died is well documented). In these circumstances, Reddit administrators may apply a quarantine. 

The purpose of quarantining a community is to prevent its content from being accidentally viewed by those who do not knowingly wish to do so, or viewed without appropriate context.  We’ve also learned that quarantining a community may have a positive effect on the behavior of its subscribers by publicly signaling that there is a problem. This both forces subscribers to reconsider their behavior and incentivizes moderators to make changes.     

Quarantined communities display a warning that requires users to explicitly opt-in to viewing the content (similar to how the NSFW community warning works). Quarantined communities generate no revenue, do not appear in non-subscription-based feeds (eg Popular), and are not included in search or recommendations. Other restrictions, such as limits on community styling, crossposting, the share function, etc. may also be applied. Quarantined subreddits and their subscribers are still fully obliged to abide by Reddit’s [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) and remain subject to enforcement measures in cases of violation.  

Moderators will be notified via modmail if their community has been placed in quarantine. To be removed from quarantine, subreddit moderators may present an appeal [here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com). The appeal should include a detailed accounting of changes to community moderation practices. (Appropriate changes may vary from community to community and could include techniques such as adding more moderators, creating new rules, employing more aggressive auto-moderation tools, adjusting community styling, etc.) The appeal should also offer evidence of sustained, consistent enforcement of these changes over a period of at least one month, demonstrating meaningful reform of the community. 

You can find more detailed information on the quarantine appeal and review process [here](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/quarantined-subreddits).

This is another step in how we’re thinking about enforcement on Reddit and how we can best incentivize positive behavior.  We’ll continue to review the impact of these techniques and what’s working (or not working), so that we can assess how to continue to evolve our policies. If you have any communities you’d like to report, tell us about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/reddit.com) and we’ll review. Please note that because of the high volume of reports received we can’t individually reply to every message, but a human will review each one.",-

NSFW filter works fine. There is no need to start trying act like arbiters of truth and start suppressing stuff that is ""offensive"", whatever that might mean in the future.

I get it, you don't like a certain opinion. But that's not fault of the community holding the opinion. To punish their community is kinda dumb. Especially seeing the bad double standard on supporting racism when directed at white people while being against racism against minorities with reddit admins, I cannot see how quarantine feature will not be used to silence unpopular opinions. Hell, you're saying offensive opinions should be quarantined. 

&gt;Nevertheless, due to the warning system, if you encounter a quarantined subreddit, you will know it. 

So where is the danger of creating your own list? You're acting kinda childish here with this ""I don't want others to SEE their opinion. Being transparent isn't a bad thing, and I don't see why would it hurt in this endeavor: People can see if communities are wrongfully quarantined and discuss it easier when it's on public.

Oh wait, quarantine's idea is not to create discussion or feel of community, is it?

Granted reddit is a company that cares about it's image, and it's a good excuse for something like /r/spacedicks which is something you definitely should not see unless you were looking for it, however since it's been quarantined, that sub has pretty much died, and I think just because someone (or even most people) disagrees with the content doesn't mean it should be smothered until it's gone. 

I still see Reddit as a free-speech website, a place where you used to be able to find anything and everything, and a place where the unpopular opinion could have a voice and sometimes even an intelligent discussion. I know T_D was basically a troll sub, which sucks because I can't tell anyone I'm a trump supporter without them genuinely thinking I'm a racist homophobe circle jerking moron (I have my reasons, but people are so passionately against the guy they won't even hear me out), and I get a lot of recent reddit censorship is trying to justify the reason they're bad and prevent future similar situations, but I think killing what made me fall in love with reddit is the wrong choice. 

Quarantining is a step in the right direction, sure, but with the death of spacedicks I'm not sure it is the right direction, yet. Reddit was a great outlet to find stuff you couldn't find anywhere else, and it's steered away from that. Sometimes I like to pop my head into the crazy and extreme simply to try and understand it and broaden my horizons. 

My only suggestion is to focus on brigading and other forms of sub bleeding (example, removing fatpeoplehate just caused it to flood everywhere else), but still allow these communities to exist in their own pocket where they can be easily found by curious or like minded people, so they don't die like spacedicks did.

Here's what they found in short:

&gt;In 2015, Reddit closed several subreddits—foremost among them r/fatpeoplehate and r/CoonTown—due to
violations of Reddit’s anti-harassment policy. However, the effectiveness of banning as a moderation approach
remains unclear: banning might diminish hateful behavior, or it may relocate such behavior to different parts
of the site. We study the ban of r/fatpeoplehate and r/CoonTown in terms of its effect on both participating
users and affected subreddits. Working from over 100M Reddit posts and comments, we generate hate speech
lexicons to examine variations in hate speech usage via causal inference methods. We find that the ban worked
for Reddit. More accounts than expected discontinued using the site; those that stayed drastically decreased
their hate speech usage—by at least 80%. Though many subreddits saw an influx of r/fatpeoplehate and
r/CoonTown “migrants,” those subreddits saw no significant changes in hate speech usage. In other words,
other subreddits did not inherit the problem.

John Naughton is professor of the public understanding of technology at the Open University. earlier this year he wrote a [clear opinion piece](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/18/extremism-pays-why-silicon-valley-not-shutting-it-down-youtube) on how you, reddit, as a social media site, profit off hosting extremism.

&gt;The tech giants’ need for ‘engagement’ to keep revenues flowing means they are loath to stop driving viewers to ever-more unsavoury content

You're dressing up shit instead of banning it, even though you **know banning hate works**

He writes:

&gt;Watching social media executives trying to square this circle is like watching worms squirming on the head of a pin. The latest hapless exhibit is YouTube’s chief executive, Susan Wojcicki, who went to the South by Southwest conference in Texas last week to outline measures intended to curb the spread of misinformation on her platform. This will be achieved, apparently, by showing – alongside conspiracy-theory videos, for example – “additional information cues, including a text box linking to third-party sources [about] widely accepted events, like the moon landing”. It seems that the source of these magical text boxes will be Wikipedia.

Reddit isn't doing even that. Reddit is guaranteeing echo chambers of junk content who in many cases **actively ban** dissent or dissenting voices. 

In public, reddit's top staff are calling this ""valuable conversation"" worth having.


----

In a [speech earlier this september](https://points.datasociety.net/media-manipulation-strategic-amplification-and-responsible-journalism-95f4d611f462) 

Danah Boyd says, very accutely:

&gt;Over the last 25 years, the tech industry has held steadfast to its commitment to creating new pathways for people who historically have not had access to the tools of scaled communication. Yet, at this very moment, those who built these tools and imagined letting a thousand flowers bloom are stepping back and wondering: what hath we wrought? Like the ACLU and other staunch free speech advocates, we all recognized that we would need to accept a certain amount of ugly speech. But never in their wildest imaginations did the creators of major social media realize that their tools of amplification would be weaponized to radicalize people towards extremism, gaslight publics, or serve as vehicles of cruel harassment.

Reddit is quickly becoming the only major platform without rules against hate speech.

Reddit is becoming (if it isn't already) the platform where haters gather to hate, unobstructed by mods who insulate their views against counter-speech and examination.

**1)** Why is reddit not banning hate speech when it works?

**2)** Why is reddit allowing hateful echo chambers

Every developed country in the world has some form of law on the books against hate speech except the United States. There are tonnes of legally practiced, clear, objective definitions with decades of jurisprudence to take from.

**3)** Why isn't reddit's policy team taking hate speech seriously?

**4)** What are the 3 biggest reasons for quarantining rather than banning the shittiest communities you choose to host? What are the 3 biggest reasons reddit view **for** banning hate communities rather than quarantining them? What other options in between are you considering, like banning removal of comments for dissenting with the circlejerk?

Quarantined communities don't get ads. They're effectively subsidized by the rest of reddit. all of reddit is paying to host its worst communities.

**5)** Why does, and should reddit sponsor hate?",False

I think that was at 3rd grade.

Imagine if I put a sticky on r/news demanding all my subscribers go after a public figure or another subreddit. How long do you think it would  take you to intervene?

 We all know the answer to this. It would not last a day. Yet, there is a double standard in play here that has been ongoing for so long it's below the status of an anomaly by any definition. 

When people threaten to hang, lynch, murder, rape or otherwise harm actual people, every other subreddit is expected to get on that shit immediately. Let's not forget the [constant russian propaganda](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/reddit-russian-propagandists-try-new-tricks-n913131) that festers there.  But if it's on  T_D? Naw, thats just boys being boys right?  Valuable voices amirite? 

Don't say you need reports. Don't say you are not aware of the issues there. Please don't insult our intelligence this way. We know you have seen them. We know for some insane reason nothing is going to happen to this subreddit that constantly breaks sitewide rules. 

It is not the legit political content I object to. It is their behavior as a reddit community. Brigading, harassing, racism, sexism, violent rhetoric.... But most frightening - **radicalizing vulnerable kids who just need to feel they belong to something.** This is something Reddit is directly responsible for in my opinion. 

 Landoflobsters I am not blaming you specifically. This is a massive failure at the policy level. It's way too easy to turn a blind eye instead of getting the balls out on the table and handling the problem. It is probably too late to do the right thing anyhow.

I'm a liberal, Canadian brown guy (before you all start visualizing the racist, white American Trump-voting male). I've gone on t_d just to get a feel for the place over the years and it's not just ONE thing, there's normal people on there, there are nationalists, there are trolls and satirists, there are defiant people there just because they are told that they're shit humans for being there, there are racists and sexists there, there probably are a few actual Nazis too. This is true for ALL subreddits and all communities, there will always be people that hold beliefs which stand opposed to your own. 

**SO WHAT?**



Why are you people so eager to banish everything? When you get rid of #1, #2 becomes #1, people won't stop complaining or being hurt or offended, the next thing is just going to become the new offensive thing. You have to be able to accept opinions and beliefs that threaten your world view or even those that you consider dangerous, including racist, homophobic or otherwise anti-social ones. The solution to fighting bad ideas isn't to sanitize the world and just sweep them under the rug, the solution is to promote better ideas and hope the audience is persuaded.

This is so insane. But *I feel* insane because I know I'm likely to get heavily downvoted and have my association to some subreddits (kotakuinaction, for example, one I'm sure many of you will want guaranteed or banned as well) or some comment I've made in the past be used to completely dismiss my stance as some bad faith ploy.

    n.
    The systematic propagation of a doctrine or cause or of information reflecting the views and interests of those advocating such a doctrine or cause.
    n.
    Material disseminated by the advocates or opponents of a doctrine or cause: wartime propaganda.


What is wrong with this? Should anything that tries to change someone's view be banned?

I don't understand you borderline-fascists. What is wrong with discussion and differing opinions? Propaganda is looked down upon for a good reason, but most times it is used to show off a problem, statistic or a fact. Propaganda does not mean ""everything factually incorrect"". Some propaganda shows a problem in a policy, like the Article 13 propaganda memes. Some lie, of course, but some don't.

So when is propaganda wrong? When it tries to change someone's view? Or is the view that it tries to change the problem?

Is the problem that it goes against you?

Propaganda is not always a bad thing. The hatred of propaganda comes from usage of propaganda in intellectual papers or journalistic work, where they should not belong.

- epistemic would be the construction of a body of rhetoric and 'knowledge' that serves only to provide justification for physical violence against a group. A good example would be the ideological campaign run by Hutu Power in Rwanda through the 60s-90s - creating 'facts' that contravene anthropological, archeological, cultural, linguistic, and genetic evidence in order to argue that the Tutsi were a different race, rather than social class.

- hypothetical is fairly easy to agree on: imagined or planned acts of violence discussed in earnest. You can see numerous examples of this on T_D with comments discussing the hanging/lynching of political opponents often staying up for months before mod removal

- political is hard to distinguish from epistemic violence as it follows the same form basis of justification, except instead of physical violence it's carried out through malicious engineering of the political systems. Stuff like jerrymandering, removal of voting polls from low-income neighborhoods, and voter ID all target specific demographics in was that - while they may not be physically violent - harm the existence of those people through the theft of their political agency and basic rights.

Who decides on these definitions?

 We all do.

Fighting to silence those with opinions you don't like (and as far as I can tell ""fascist"" at this point just means somebody who you don't agree with) is a bad way to go about the world, a dangerous way to live, and do you not think that if it becomes a popular tool for social and political competition that it wont end up being employed at the government level?

I've watched / catalogued the shenanigans of T_D since its inception. The admins did, at one point, swap out the entire (or nearly the entire) moderation team of the subreddit, when they were directing their subscribers to go out and harass / terrify users on the site.

That was during a period when the people on the T_D moderation team were *almost certainly* employees of Breitbart / Stephen Bannon / the Mercers, and one of their (obvious) goals was to bait some social media into shutting down some forum dedicated to a politician, so that could be used for propaganda purposes  -- or be used as pretext for a lawsuit that would result in case law that would remove control from user-content-hosting ISPs to address the content posted to their sites *at all* without a court order.

Reddit's admins were in a no-win Catch-22 situation as regards T_D before the election, and I believe (without reservation) that had Hillary Clinton won the Presidency, T_D would have been shut down within weeks, or at least would have wound up quarantined due to the actions of its users (while law enforcement used it).

But 

Reddit, like all other corporations operating in the United States, are required to comply with court orders, including court orders issued pursuant to law enforcement investigations, and are required to comply with National Security Letters. 

Moreover, they cannot publicly discuss or disclose these if they're sealed (or if they're NSLs).

They *can* give us *really flimsy justifications* that *technically hold up to a court's examination*, for the actions they are forced to take to remain in compliance with these orders, though -- which is about the only thing someone under a sealed subpoena or NSL, *can* do.

This *is* a massive failure at the policy level.

It's not a massive failure at the Reddit policy level.

It's a massive failure at the level of America's public discourse.

It's time to reject the [Begala / Tucker Carlson / CNN's *Crossfire* / Fox ""News""] model of public civic discourse that allowed all of this to gain oxygen. 

It's time that we develop and popularise *actual standards of what counts as real discussion* and reject conflict-driven Circus spectacles.",False

That sadly does not defend anything.

I would love to discuss this with you, but ignoring the main question and just saying stuff everyone knows about (T_D does bad stuff wow never heard before) does not answer anything and does not help with any kind of discussion.

And T_D doing something bad isn't why you should attack cringeanarchy. That's just childish talk.

&gt; Both the government and private companies can censor stuff. But private companies are a little bit scarier. They have no constitution to answer to. They’re not elected. They have no constituents or voters. All of the protections we’ve built up to protect against government tyranny don’t exist for corporate tyranny.
&gt;
&gt; Is the internet going to stay free? Are private companies going to censor [the] websites I visit, or charge more to visit certain websites? Is the government going to force us to not visit certain websites? **And when I visit these websites, are they going to constrain what I can say, to only let me say certain types of things, or steer me to certain types of pages?** All of those are battles that we’ve won so far, and we’ve been very lucky to win them.

Your increasing tendency to ban communities and the heavy handed moderation that most communities are subjected to is more than enough.

Like this: [https://www.reddit.com/api/info.json?id=t5\_2fwo](https://www.reddit.com/api/info.json?id=t5_2fwo)  


I compiled a list of subreddits (and those IDs) by using the (amazing) resource of comment/post data scraped from Reddit monthly by  u/Stuck_In_the_Matrix and maintained by u/fhoffa, on Bigquery. (I think credit appropriately given where due, there.)  


After collecting a table of valid subreddits from that corpus of comments, I basically just grabbed 740 listings worth of information about those 7,312 subreddits, 100 at a time, and filled in the blanks for the fields of information I know the API returns about each subreddit, including the quarantine field.  


Now, there might actually be some collecting bias in the scraping that doesn't include quarantined communities, but I don't think there is.

&gt; Both the government and private companies can censor stuff. But private companies are a little bit scarier. They have no constitution to answer to. They’re not elected. They have no constituents or voters. All of the protections we’ve built up to protect against government tyranny don’t exist for corporate tyranny.
&gt;
&gt; Is the internet going to stay free? Are private companies going to censor [the] websites I visit, or charge more to visit certain websites? Is the government going to force us to not visit certain websites? **And when I visit these websites, are they going to constrain what I can say, to only let me say certain types of things, or steer me to certain types of pages?** All of those are battles that we’ve won so far, and we’ve been very lucky to win them.

It absolutely will. And as someone who very much believes in sunlight and engagement as the best disinfectant, I don't think it helps the problem so much as hides it.

Reddit has actually made me start to question whether it's worth it. People just..arent very good at thinking past their emotions. It takes an *enormous* amount of work to pull someone out of the muck, and they are generally clawing and scratching you the whole way. Add a community aspect where they get high fives for doing so, and it looks like less and less attractive work.

I'm realizing that, at least for me personally, I'm not sure that I actually care about the rest of you enough to continually subject myself to that. In that spirit, I understand the idea of quarantine. 

I hate that it is essentially giving up. But I'm not sure I'm willing to devote hours of my life to trying to pull someone's head out of their own ass with long, thought out posts and discussion when they'll just downvote it, laugh, and think themselves clever for doing so. ",False

These communities have significant overlap between each other, and use non-quarantined/more normal subreddits to launder views, in order to push them towards more extreme content. Virtually all of the call-out subreddits not specifically dedicated to calling out reddit reactionaries (e.g. /r/quityourbullshit, /r/justiceserved, /r/subredditcancer) serve or have served this function, with half of their content being posted by /r/cringeanarchy regulars. 

Quarantining subreddits like /r/cringeanarchy only makes them more likely to radicalize, and more likely to influence other content on the site. The issue isn't front-page users looking in but regulars within the subreddit cross-posting. /r/all was actually a moderating force on the subreddit, limiting to a certain degree how crazy the subreddit could get. When the subreddit is left on it's own, you get content like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/9gtzle/based_poland/) where it's literally just explicit anti-gay, anti-Semitic stuff, i.e. actual neo-Nazi stuff.

The reason quarantining political subreddits instead of banning them is a bad idea is twofold:

1. It prevents people from easily determining whether or not something is posted with an agenda.
2. It lets them continue to organize on the site, strengthens censorship narratives while not addressing the problem. You're still going to have people funneled into those communities through reactionary content on other subreddits; just adding the additional step of organization having to take place off-site does significantly more to address the issue.",False

Thought experiment: Lets say Ben Shapiro buys up a massive speaking venue. He calls it a place that believes in the principle of free speech. He invites people of all political views. When a right-wing speaker is coming, he lets them on stage with a nice loud speaker system. When a left-wing speaker is coming, he places them in the back, in the dark, and they must just use their own voice, no microphone. Do you think people from the left would agree that Ben is being unbiased and is allowing people from different communities the same voice?

If Reddit came out tomorrow explicitly as a left-wing political activism website, then the debate would be over because this would quite clearly no longer be an open forum, and those with non-left-leaning opinions should look elsewhere.

That reminds me of a quote I just read:

&gt;I think all censorship should be deplored. My position is that bits are not a bug – that we should create communications technologies that allow people to send whatever they like to each other. And when people put their thumbs on the scale and try to say what can and can’t be sent, we should fight back – both politically through protest and technologically through software

&gt;Both the government and private companies can censor stuff. But private companies are a little bit scarier. They have no constitution to answer to. They’re not elected. They have no constituents or voters. All of the protections we’ve built up to protect against government tyranny don’t exist for corporate tyranny.

&gt;Is the internet going to stay free? Are private companies going to censor [the] websites I visit, or charge more to visit certain websites? Is the government going to force us to not visit certain websites? And when I visit these websites, are they going to constrain what I can say, to only let me say certain types of things, or steer me to certain types of pages? All of those are battles that we’ve won so far, and we’ve been very lucky to win them. But we could quite easily lose, so we need to stay vigilant.

Let's go to your own Wikipedia article:

&gt; Neo-Nazism consists of post-World War IImilitant social or political movements seeking to revive and implement the ideology of Nazism. Neo-Nazis seek to employ their ideology to promote hatred and attack minorities, or in some cases to create a fascist political state.[1][2] It is a global phenomenon, with organized representation in many countries and international networks. It borrows elements from Nazi doctrine, including ultranationalism, racism up to xenophobia, ableism, homophobia, anti-Romanyism, antisemitism, anti-communismand initiating the Fourth Reich. Holocaust denial is a common feature, as is the incorporation of Nazi symbols and admiration of Adolf Hitler.

&gt; The term Neo-Nazism describes any post-World War II militant, social or political movements seeking to revive the ideology of Nazism in whole or in part.[4][5]

&gt; The term neo-Nazism can also refer to the ideology of these movements, which may borrow elements from Nazi doctrine, including ultranationalism, anti-communism, racism, ableism, xenophobia, homophobia, anti-Romanyism, antisemitism, up to initiating the Fourth Reich. Holocaust denial is a common feature, as is the incorporation of Nazi symbols and admiration of Adolf Hitler.

You want to talk about **membership in self-described neo-Nazi organizations**, but that's not the way shit works these days - if it ever did. 

Meanwhile, the alt-right are over here hitting all these bullet points, and you want to wring your hands about whether or not it's *really* okay to call them that. Whether you personally support them or not, you are doing their work for them by pushing their bulls plausible deniability arguments.

By this logic, should anybody who watches media that glorifies violence should be judged guilty as if they had committed a violent crime? Like because Marx calls for violence, anybody who supports Marx's theories is beyond a supporter of a violent ideology, *but should be treated as if they themselves personally called for violence?*

Don't get me wrong: I am a Marxist. This is to say that I recognize the scientifically accurate model for understanding history and society in the context of dialectic materialism; that I believe that capitalism is not only an unfair system, but an ultimately inefficient and illogical way of organization a society's production; that the end to capitalism is not only necessary for the survival of humans on this planet, but is a historical inevitability that will be rendered false only with the environmental constraints of our home crushing us as a species.

This is my opinion--one I personally think is a founded one--but nonetheless my opinion. So far so good.

As a Marxist, I furthermore recognize that not only *can* the bourgeoisie--the tiny group of parasites that have direct control over the overwhelming majority of the world's resources--protect their position with violence, that they not only have a *vested interest* in doing so, but most importantly *have very openly* murdered millions of people (and continue to do so to this day) in order to protect their position. And as a Marxist, the combination of communism's necessity and the bourgeoisie's unwillingness to allow humanity to progress makes an armed struggle necessary.

Again, this is my opinion. I have not, in this space, endorsed or called for violence. Only because I recognize the limitations of this platform, both legal and economic. *However*, it would be *asinine* to categorically sanction this as ""hate speech"" and hold it equivalent to calling for violence.

If you disagree, then what do you think about /r/USMC/? Or /r/Capitalism/? Or /r/liberalism? How about /r/democrats/ or /r/Republican/? Those last two are subreddits for parties that have gone *faaaar* beyond ""calling for violence"". They have *actually* KILLED millions of people, IN REAL LIFE. These communities amount to legitimizing, popularizing, and justifying *literal ethnic cleansing campaigns*.

I don't think that those should be banned, even though I think that those parties should be excised from this planet like the cancer that they are. I do, however, think fascist subreddits should be banned. Because unlike capitalist or socialist ideology, fascism is *ideologically bereft*. There is no other belief in fascism besides violence. For capitalism and Marxism, violence is just a medium, a tool that is used *alongside* a fully-fledged ideology. Violence does not by any means *define* capitalism or communism. But it does define fascism.

But beyond that, you're necessarily using a completely arbitrary standard of morality that conveniently overlooks the very real, almost omnipresent manifestation of capitalism's violence.",False

Reddit once said:

&gt; At reddit we care deeply about not imposing ours or anyone elses’ opinions on how people use the reddit platform. We are adamant about not limiting the ability to use the reddit platform even when we do not ourselves agree with or condone a specific use.

And promised:

&gt; We will tirelessly defend the right to freely share information on reddit in any way we can, even if it is offensive or discusses something that may be illegal.

And later clarified:

&gt; We stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits. We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it. Not because that's the law in the United States - because as many people have pointed out, privately-owned forums are under no obligation to uphold it - but because we believe in that ideal independently, and that's what we want to promote on our platform. We are clarifying that now because in the past it wasn't clear, and (to be honest) in the past we were not completely independent and there were other pressures acting on reddit. Now it's just reddit, and we serve the community, we serve the ideals of free speech, and we hope to ultimately be a universal platform for human discourse


Now you stand before the community and are essentially telling us:

&gt; I am altering the deal, Pray I don't alter it any further

When will this end?  There is no end state for the people calling for increasing censorship.

Am I refusing to accept the claim that millions of Ukrainians were deliberately killed, a claim that originated among Nazi collaborators and has no evidence to back it? Yes, of course I am.

Am I accepting the counterargument that many Ukrainians died because kulaks decided that they would rather burn their crop stores than allow millions of their neighbors to rise out of the feudal cesspit that was the Russian Empire? Yeah, I am. Because that actually does have evidence to support it.

&gt; Or the genocides under Mao?

Yes, I am definitely denying that. The moral equivocation you are making between people being systematically gassed for being Jews or gay on the one hand and the conflict between people who want to revert to feudalism and those who no longer want to needlessly die from tuberculosis on the other *is absolutely disgusting* and itself a Nazi-sympathizing position. It is a disgrace to the victims of the Holocaust and you should honestly be ashamed for parroting literal Nazi propaganda.

&gt; When you combine this with the history of communists violently genociding ""bourgeoisie"" - such as Kulaks - you can begin to see how this becomes comparable to describing certain ethnic groups as parasites.

Except that the bourgeoisie is not an ethnic group--nor are Kulaks. Unlike ethnicity, class is a completely artificial concept that can be chosen. Your ethnicity is not something you have any control over, nor does your ethnicity compel you to exploit, enslave, or murder others. On the other hand, the very fundamental operating principles of capitalism *compel* the bourgeoisie, by definition, to exploit, enslave, and murder others. And even if it hadn't, the people targeted by communists *are people who actually have exploited, enslaved, and murdered others*.

&gt; Now I'm not saying you personally are calling for violence, infact you seem mostly reasonable, but much of these communist subreddits are not reasonable

That's a point I can agree on. I don't entirely support everything that goes on in these subs and I don't think I really like the ironic distance that a lot of the more over-the-top posts feature. That being said, I personally believe that violence against the bourgeoisie is both necessary and justified. Being a public platform with legal and economic limitations, I wouldn't openly call for explicit violence here. But I would encourage people to consider the arguments for it, study the experiences of the historically oppressed and their struggles, and prepare for the necessity of violence against the bourgeoisie.

Not for any arbitrary reason, the way that fascists call for violence against ethnic groups, and not for ethically bankrupt reasons, the way capitalists sanction violence against pretty much anybody for profit's sake. But simply because the bourgeoisie *is actively murdering people!* The Nazis killed far fewer than the US military kills today. I don't think supporting violence against Nazis is the same as Nazis violently suppressing Jews. Nor do I think supporting violence against the bourgeoisie is the same as Nazis violently suppressing Jews. And nobody should, except for Nazi sympathizers and neocolonialism apologists.",False

 1. It biases political discussions on Reddit towards Statism and assumes the legitimacy of (some) State’s violence.
 2. It’s not a clear standard in practice potentially introducing bias as admins and moderators interpret the standard in different ways, and users proactively self censor themselves to protect their accounts and subreddits

That is definitely a basis for a discussion in good faith, unless one party comes in and refuses to accept the other side's position in favor of putting words in their mouth.

As a social democrat I believe that socialists have some good points that shouldn't be dismissed off hand using broad brush strokes and rough equivalencies to China or the USSR, as they often are in the US. I also think that socialist politics have often had a positive influence on political systems in the EU and in Canada overall, and can definitely have a positive influence on US politics too by balancing out the political spectrum and correcting for a shifting Overton window.

I would also readily jump to the defense of liberalism or even possibly conservatism (though not the far-right kind found in the US). Because I can see the merits of those too.

Socialism is not social policy.  Socialism is a system where the government controls the means of production on behalf of the people, ostensibly for their good but in practice to their detriment.

It's ok to say they have some good points, but thats quite different than defending the concept of socialism.

&gt;I also think that socialist politics 

No.  neither of those places are socialist.  Social policies are not socialism.  You are conflating definitions that aren't equal.

&gt;I would not say they are particularly great at mitigating corporate tyranny, however, so I didn't bring them up this time.

Trading corporate tyranny for government tyranny via socialism is not a good trade.  The point is to be against tyranny, and socialism devolves into tyranny.  historical fact.

You're giving me attention because you feel the need to defend socialism while claiming to be a non socialist ""social democrat"", and you're worried that my replies make your arguments look weak (they do) and want to push your politics like everyone else.

It's not about vilifying you, its about getting a straight answer out of you without so much dissembling and equating any social policy to socialism.

This is the opposite of what I said. Learn to strawman. The Holocaust can't be denied because there is actual proof that it happened. Testimonies, corpses, mass graves, confiscated personal belongings, photographs, and documented records.

By the same token, the so-called ""Holodomor"", i.e. famine related deaths as a somehow deliberate genocide can absolutely be denied. That's because there's no evidence to suggest that it was deliberate, kulaks are not an ethnic group, but rather a class, and most importantly--the exact opposite is supported by evidence: that the deaths were caused by kulaks who would rather die and kill millions of innocents than observe the conditions that were democratically established for land ownership.

Let's be clear: *the kulaks literally killed themselves*. The true mistake that Lenin, then Stalin made was allowing them to survive as a class (note: I said *as a class*), precipitating the unnecessary deaths of so many others.

If you want to blame the state, blame it for its outrageous leniency when dealing with those parasites.

&gt;but you could also argue all day about the Holocaust, and they will try and throw ""facts"" at you

I could not argue about the Holocaust. I would never do that. Because there exists very clear and explicit evidence that it was a deliberate and systematic campaign for ethnic cleansing.

On the other hand, there exists no evidence of a deliberate famine (because that's fucking ridiculous, the technology to bribe the clouds not to rain just didn't exist back then), kulaks were a class and not an ethnic group, and plenty of evidence exists that the kulaks burned their grain, killing themselves and many others.

&gt;Not all bourgeoisie are evil

I don't care if they are good or evil. They do 0% of the work, take 100% of the profits and return a tiny percentage back to the people do produced the thing they sold. That's exploitation, by definition. If people demand more or simply organize to opt out, they repress them brutally. Not because they are inherent bad people, but because capitalism requires them to do this or to stop being a part of the bourgeoisie, simple as that.

&gt;You claim you are different because when you consider violence ""its not arbitrary"", you claim violence is ""justified and necessary"" - Nazis will do the same thing; they claim that minorities are evil, that killing them is justified because it will make society better. You dont call for violence, but you do say ""violence is justified and necessary"" and would want people to consider it as a option. When Nazis argue for the genocide of  nonwhites, or leftists, or homosexuals, they will also ""not advocate violence"", but claim that its ""justified and necessary"" and try and push people towards those ideas. If we are censoring Nazis for this, then we should censor Communists for this too.

If you think that Nazis ""do the same thing"" then you are either a Nazi sympathizer or just *drowning* in the koolaid of ideology. When the Allies mobilized violently against the Nazis, this was not ""the same"" as when the Nazis carried out genocide. When the USSR defeated the Nazis--violently--this was not ""the same"" as the Holocaust. And when communists support stopping capitalism's ongoing genocides, this is not ""the same"" as the opportunism of fascism when it directs violence against scapegoats. Grow the fuck up.",False

I have a story.

My uncle who lives in Michigan and died a few years ago had a baby with his wife when they were both quite old (relatively speaking, this was probably 50 years ago).  His wife wanted an abortion but I don't think it was available to them in the 70s.  The boy was born with Downs Syndrome and I think his wife held it against him.   

I think this really made an impression on my uncle and he was against any sort of abortion at all.  On top of being very Catholic, i think he felt that if his wife could have had an abortion he wouldn't have had his son, and that would have been a disaster because he really really loved that kid.  No fault there, the kid has turned into a really good person and a productive member of society.

He wasn't a bad guy.  Very conservative, took care of his family and dollars to donuts he would have supported Trump.

I feel like if we could get to know people and their motivations it might make more sense or at least see how they arrived at their conclusions.

Yeah, how about literally just r/politics? You weren't here during the primaries when that sub changed from pro-Bernie to pro-Hillary overnight? Constant slide threads by ShareBlue / CorrectTheRecord paid off by George Soros? That's exactly the same.

Like I said - for something to be Russian Propaganda, it would need to be pro-Russian, else it's just propaganda. Are you suggesting that no other entity apart from Americans are allowed to put forward pros and cons about either candidate? That's absolutely ridiculous and you must know it. 

You can easily take examples of news articles by the BBC for example that were incredibly biased against Trump and pro-Hillary - that, by your own definition is propaganda.

I'm as much against SuperPACS as you are. But also keep in mind that Soros is an American citizen.

That's obviously not what I'm arguing. We're talking about *influencing campaigns managed and organized by a foreign state*.

I don't think you should just have the power to quarantine people from being seen by others. I think you guys love exerting your power over users. For example you banning subreddits. Could you perhaps, un-ban some of the subs you have recently banned?  You defining what is or what is not 'bad for the community' is and censoring on a whim is a massive overstepping of bounds. The internet and supposedly reddit was popularized because people could share new ideas and exert their free speech. The founder of reddit, Aaron Swartz, died for this belief, and the fact that you have turned your back on him is frankly a shame. If nothing that a group does is explicitly illegal then why should you feel the need to censor the group? I understand why it could be bad for advertisers, but now that you have this quarantine ability, why not bring back the non-illegal subreddits. Specifically I am talking about /r/greatawakening. If the posts and posters their beliefs are are so *wrong*, then why not let them post and let people see how wrong they are? If the posts are so harmful, then surely quarantining them is enough. I am concerned about how reddit mods, a completely unelected group of people, can censor people on a whim with no appeal.

&gt;You’re right, words are not violence. I’m not arguing over banning anything, but I am asking why you think it’s perfectly acceptable to go up to a gay person and call them a faggot who deserves to die. **Why is that acceptable behavior that deserves to be protected to you?**

So you don't believe their speech should be protected. Unprotected speech is banned speech. Have you done a 180 in the hour since you posted that?


&gt; I just don’t see why it’s so important to you that someone has the right to call someone a faggot.

I don't particularly care what somebody chooses to call somebody else. The exact words don't matter. I've already articulated why free speech is such a fundamental right, but just to give another go at getting through - without the right to free expression, the humanity of every person affected is inescapably lessened. **You** want to destroy that right, **you** want to oppress those who disagree with you, you want to make everyone *less* than they are.

&gt;Do you have proof of this to the same degree of the proof I linked you?

I don't have the time to go searching for the evidence that does exist however I will concede that it won't be to the same level as what you provided. 

&gt;That's obviously not what I'm arguing.

But it feels that way. You're suggesting that it's automatically BAD propaganda simply because it's non-American. That there's anything wrong with this viewpoint simply because it's not American. Like I said, none of it is pro-Russian. 

&gt;We're talking about influencing campaigns managed and organized by a foreign state.

Like I said - it depends on how much influence you think they had, in a sub that was already 100% voting for Trump, to make people want to vote for Trump. 

&gt; So why bring it up? Was I supposed to be incapable of criticizing my preferred politician? That's a trait much more commonly found in The_Donald.

The point being is that surely that link is evidence of ""Russian collusion"" by Obama, but for some reason some Russian guys making pro-Trump posts on Reddit is really bad? In any case remember I'm banned from that sub - I don't agree with everything they do either. However, I don't think that banning the entire sub is any kind of reasonable solution. 

It feels like we're not going to agree on this issue so I'll end it here. You can reply with closing statements if you like but I see no point in trying to change each other's mind in futility.

I've found in this issue that there are continual attempts to shy away from quantification and specifics. A lot of appeals to folksy wisdom and common knowledge. Pastors all over would be proud.

You need parameters for accusations like that. Definitions, paths of logic at the least. You need lines between who is and isn't, and a structure of thought for making those decisions that is something other than decrees from on high.

I have absolutely zero problem with calling nazis by what they are. My problem comes in the weasel attempts to slowly expand this definition beyond anything resembling historicity or logic, simply because you enjoy calling people you dislike by the worst word we have.

So let me start off with standard and FAIR criticism that the COMMUNITY is the reason that Reddit is even a company nor in business and that community was built by early commitments by Reddit to be a place of open discussion and discourse dedicated to free and ""legal"" (let's ignore that caveat for now) after wooing the Craigslist Rants and Raves emigrants after the Ebay had that platform shutdown along with other similar moves across the discussion space in the mid to late oughts.  What we are all starting to see is shades of that shit again (well not shades anymore) that all started when /u/spez took over as CEO whom I'm rather positive was installed in that position by the 2014 venture capital float on the condition he acts as their personnel hatchet man cue the recent war on people that insulted one of their intersex spouses. Now all that is legitimate and fair business practice BUT you are simply burning your community down on tactical battles undermining the long term viability of the business THOUGH once again maybe that is all intentional, i.e. maybe the majority shareholders want cash out and run and maybe /u/Spez secretly hopes so he can buy back into the company for less than he sold it; lots of founders to that though it never works for them outside a labor of love.  This recent shit is bad for Reddit and like it or hate it, it will benefit the competition which in the long run will hurt Reddit in the same way MySpace, Sun, IBM sowed the seeds of their own irrelevant.

So now lets get into the particulars:

&gt; average redditors may nevertheless find highly offensive or upsetting

The problem here is the COMMUNITY DOESN'T TRUST YOU.  This is like when the SCOTUS rules on obscenity and holds a case even though the community norm long since quit holding that material obscene.   You are making an assertion which everybody understands is a lie and it would help your case if you openly released metrics on that, i.e. ""we use statistically sound impartial measuring techniques to determine the average Redditor and then randomly poll tens of thousands of them of them on specific subs to determine if in fact they find it offensive or upsetting and, if so, would agree it should be quarantined"".  You guys are basically pulling the ""OMFG THINK OF THE CHILDREN"" argument when we all damn well know children aren't that fragile or naive and are indifferent to whatever it is that is being banned in their name.

&gt; not seriously up for debate (eg, the Holocaust did happen and the number of people who died is well documented). 

Well the first part of that is true; not washing ones after coming from the morgue before delivering a baby was also not up for serious debate and the inappropriateness of doing so was also verifiable; thank God Reddit didn't exist back then.   Equally Reddit is starting to fall victim of goodspeak and appears to be a believer in the much discredited Sapir–Whorf hypothesis which I find amusing because under your own point here you would quarantine yourself given your believe in said hypothesis.

I heard the exact same shit from the right about Obama that I'm hearing from the left about Trump, and i didn't believe it then either). Only his actually sane and good ideas and plans get through, and the guy isn't 100% a moron as the media paints him out to be.

I mean, he's definitely arrogant, narcissistic, weak minded, and generally a bad person, but when the media hates someone they are vilified, and that's all people see and think of him. He isn't actually that bad, no one is. Look at all the actual good things he's done that no one talks about because negativity warps human brains. He's fought for gay rights, scared North Korea into brokering peace, put fake news on everyone's minds shaking the misplaced trust into the media (for better or worse for him), and has gotten more people to be interested in politics (god help us people do research beyond headlines, however.)

I approve of his immigration,stance, which is a controversial belief so I don't lump that in with the rest, and there is a strong possibility his economic actions might end up helping more than they hurt.

#**WHAT THE FUCK**

/u/spez, /u/landoflobsters anybody at reddit, I think we deserve an explanation why you are explicitly endorsing an extreme misandrist like Michael Kimmel. 

For anybody who is unaware of who Dr. Kimmel is, he runs the Stony Brook University's Center for the Study of Men and Masculinities. He goes way beyond the normal examples of feminism that people criticize. He is possibly the most influential misandrist alive. NOMAS, the organization that he founded and leads, claims that [men are not victims of domestic violence or abuse.](https://archive.fo/PwtXC). When MRAs sued (**and won**) California for denying equal rights to male victims of DV, it was Kimmel and NOMAS who protested and fought (*and lost**) for the right of California to continue denying help to male victims of abuse. Kimmel and NOMAS also believe that fathers should not seek custody after divorce, because children are best served by having their father be nothing but a breadwinner. He says that International Men's Day is the same as White History Month. Kimmel has made a career out of insisting that only men are sexist, never women. In [The Red Pill documentary](http://theredpillmovie.com/) (unrelated to /r/theredpill, it's a documentary by a feminist investigating the Men's Rights Movement), Kimmel represents the feminist views claiming that there is no need for any movement to address men's issues because men have all of the privilege and only women have any issues. This is apparently what reddit believes.

The Stony Brook Study of Men and Masculinities is NOT a Men's Studies department. Kimmel has always said that we don't need Men's Studies courses like Women's Studies, because ""every course is men's studies."" His center is about how men are terrible and how we can end our misogyny. It is not ""positive masculinity"" to tell men that we're all too privileged to have any problems and that we can't be victims of abuse or rape. It is not ""positive masculinity"" to say that only men can be sexist or enforce gender roles. It is misandry.

As a male victim of domestic violence who first joined the Men's Rights Movement after leaving an abusive relationship I am absolutely appalled by the decision of reddit admins to endorse a version of feminism that tells men that we can't be abused, and which tells male victims of domestic violence that we must have done something to deserve it. If you want to say ""not all feminists"" then we don't need to debate that now, this isn't about whether all feminists or even most feminists support these horrible views, it's about Dr. Michael Kimmel who is a slimy, disgusting misandrist who is completely indefensible. 

There's always been discussion of where the admins stand on gender issues. /r/ShitRedditSays was founded by a former admin. Ellen Pao went on to moderate /r/negareddit, a sub similar to SRS. There was the admin who accused moderators of ""mansplaining."" They made /r/TwoXChromosomes a default. But **THIS**??? This is far too much. Reddit needs to explain themselves. Banning a misogynistic subreddit is not something I'll be upset about, but redirecting people to an extreme misandrist who says that male victims of DV don't exist and don't deserve support?

Whether i agree or disagree with your point, you have a right to say it (but i might not listen). It seems like reddit is trying to limit the ability of bad actors to engage in bad-faith free speech. Everyone should be for good faith free speech. But limiting the damage of detractors is tough - how do you even know where to draw the line in the first place? 

Theres a difference between ""i disagree with open immigration and will vote accordingly here are my reasons.."" and ""i dont talk to muslim loving scum. Get rekt libtard"". Should both of these types users have the same protections? How about communities?

I think there needs to be a understanding that the reality of internet communication can actually inhibit free speech. Take for example when a bad acting subreddit raids a given post and the moderators close the thread. Happens a lot on political blackpeopletwitter posts. In these situations, the free speech of that community is hampered because of the bad faith of some. The reality is mod teams cant keep up. The moderation (at the admin level) of bad acting communities is paramount to the free speech of the rest.

Because what's under discussion here is not whether private companies are going to censor the websites anyone visits, but whether a private company is going to decide what to allow on its *own* website.

But even if we engage your argument, and Swartz's argument, on the merits as if it applies entirely to the question at hand, I think we have to interrogate the free-speech absolutism that the argument displays. There is an assumption in Western society that free speech, in the abstract, is a virtue unto itself and must therefore be protected at all costs. But of course that's a subjective point of view, as is every position about what is a virtue and what is not.

Before we evaluate the value of free speech, we must establish first principles of the discussion. By what metric do we measure whether or not a thing is a virtue? To me, we measure it by whether or not, and to what degree, it promotes a society of people with a basically decent standard of living, with relative security in their livelihoods and living situations, who have a meaningful say in the course that society takes both socially and politically, and who live without a great deal of fear for their safety and lives.

Free-speech absolutism does not promote such a society. In fact, it promotes the opposite. If we do not allow ourselves to respond with opprobrium to outright lies, to hoaxes, to misinformation and disinformation, and particularly to those individuals and groups and entities that demonstrate a pattern of expressing those things, we grant falsehood equal standing with truth. If we do not, as a society, invest in some level of gatekeeping in this respect, we *will* become a society with a great number of people who are almost entirely divorced from the truth. These, therefore, are not people with a meaningful say in the course that society takes; you cannot effectively drive a car toward a desired destination if you do not know where you are. People working from a false foundation necessarily cannot contribute to moving society toward outcomes they wish to see. And the greater this number becomes, the more its tainted votes dilute and counterbalance the votes of those who *are* informed. Ultimately, everyone except those with a vested interest in promoting falsehoods loses the ability to participate meaningfully in the deciding of the course society takes.

But who has such a vested interest? It's not the Macedonian teenagers making a few G's off of fake news websites. It's the power elite. When the people's anger is directed at phantoms and shadows, it will never be directed at them. If half the country believes that there is an immediate existential threat to their way of life and it's coming from Arabs and Mexicans, they will of course be much less likely to ask themselves how the concept of private health insurance makes any Goddamn sense. If half the country believes that Hillary Clinton ran a child-sex dungeon, they will probably not have the time or emotional energy to invest in discovering the arbitrary and capricious methods by which health care providers set the prices for medical services.

I can't say why those with a great deal of material wealth want to continue to accumulate more of it. It seems to me that one would run out of things to do with money after the first 20 or 30 million dollars. But they definitely want more of it, and they definitely don't want to give up any of the money that they have. So their interests--which, again, are the only interests served by free-speech absolutism--are in direct opposition to the metric by which I, and I suspect many other people, would define whether something is a virtue. When the wealthy get wealthier, everyone else's living standards decline or stagnate. Job security and housing security plummet. Almost everyone's voice in the social, cultural, and political movement of society is diluted to the point of being meaningless. And such a climate necessarily breeds insecurity of a darker, more violent kind. Terrorism. Gang violence. Family abuse. Mass shootings.

Our society is sick. It's sick in ways that are new. I would not say that the United States, or the West in general, or the human race in general, was ever an unadulterated ""good"" in the world. Any honest survey of our history will put the lie to that. But we are sick in a way that is novel. Nobody believes in anything anymore. Nothing can be trusted. The walls are closing in on everyone. The President of the United States, unstable and unhinged as he may be, is the most powerful human being in the world and yet is convinced that he's the target of some nefarious shadow-government plot to destroy him. Our institutions are crumbling, and even though nearly all of them deserve some of the recent animus that's been directed at them, we also need nearly all of them to survive, because we have no backups.

And that world, that sickness, was built in large part by free-speech absolutism. It was contributed to in meaningful and significant ways by a belief that every voice, no matter how facially wrong and stupid and unjustifiable it was, deserved equal time and equal prominence. And so now here we are, living in a time when ""you can't trust the experts"" is a thing people say with a straight face. Here we are, in the most technologically advanced society that has ever existed, utilizing inventions that would have seem fantastical just 20 years ago and were only made possible by science, yet the political movement with the greatest degree of control over the world's only superpower is the one that rejects the scientific consensus on multiple topics of grave importance. People argue, *on the internet*, a modern scientific marvel, that scientific experts are bought and paid for and can't be trusted. People who are only alive because of modern medicine declare that modern medicine is a hoax.

At some point, it must become acceptable for us to say that certain people, certain groups, certain entities have proven to us that they cannot be trusted to use their freedom of speech in a responsible way. We must be able to place that which is toxic and has no socially redeeming value outside the bounds of what is acceptable. I don't know if we have to do that in a way that involves the law, but we must have some way of doing it.",False

Don't worry, I'm willing to explain to young children who don't know any better.

Basically, Extreme Left Wing Ideology is literal communism and anarchism. Extreme Right Wing Ideology is Imperialism and Fascism. The difference being the level of economic exploitation against subjugated groups. 

Mainstream Left Wing Ideology is Social Democracy, represented by Bernie Sanders and 'Labour/Labor' parties around the world.  Mainstream Right Wing Ideology is Conservatism. This is represented by the GOP and other Conservative Parties.  There is of course a third faction - Centrism. These are people who are socially and economically liberal. This is the core ideology of the US Democrat Party, the current Canadian PM's party, and the French President's Party. These ideologies are the ones that normally take power in the majority of countries. It is of course not this rigid, mainstream politics at the moment mostly flows across these three positions and not into the Extreme ends of the spectrum, thus Mainstream politics is mostly in the centre of the economic spectrum. 

r/Politics is not extreme, it falls squarely into mainstream politics, very much in a centrist position. If it was calling for collective ownership of capital and for the eradication of the ruling class, it would be on the extreme left. If it was calling for genocide or the enslavement of a race of people, it would be on the extreme right. It does neither, it is not extreme. Just because there's a hostile environment towards people of conservative or fascistic views, doensn't make them far left. ",False

*  Reddit is actually the worst the internet has to offer and is now where all the coolest Nazis come to hang out. No, really, Reddit is now the official Nazi website on the internet. How did you not notice?
* On that note, did you know that banning people actually cures them of being racist? Please don't look over there, that's just Stormfront, don't mind them. Trust me, no one has ever been radicalised by this sort of thing. I even have a research paper that proves this. It looked at TV show subreddits and couldn't find racism any more. Thank you for ending racism, Reddit. Oh, well, except for all those Nazis that are holding daily rallies here, I suppose.
* Communism is actually *very good* and the idea that anything bad happened in Soviet Russia is just anti-communist propaganda. Come on, surely a guy with *Stalin* in his username can be trusted on that. All those 'purges' were actually just referring to a very healthy detox regimen. 
* Speaking of Russia, did you know that everyone posting on The_Donald is actually a Russian intelligence agent using Pepe to corrupt the beautiful moral purity of your average Redditor? Stay away! I saw a Trump meme on the front page once and now I can't stop dreaming about Putin taking his shirt off every single night. It's too late for me, but you can still save yourself! 
* Did I mention that Communism is *very good?*

Maybe turn that disingenuous reactionary mirror on yourself for a bit.

Democracies have turned into failed socialist states before.  It's what happened in venezuala.  Elected on the promise of vast welfare policies that diverted all the wealth created by the nationally owned oil company to the dole, and when the oil crash came the policies became unsustainable, and the socialist government became tyrannical and oppressed their people to maintain power, giving away control of huge parts of the economy to corrupt thugs supporting the corrupt socialist leader.

It's not capitalist propaganda - its recent history, and its ongoing.

The whole point the social democrat approach is to institute socialism slowly - to expand welfare programs to get more support, promise unsustainable programs that necessitate crisis, and use the crisis for ever more power.  Then it becomes socialism for real and by then you can't say no - protestors are attacked in the streets by either gangs of socialist thugs (colectivos in venezuala) or by the state police who have been completed replaced by socialist supporters.

The swedes are not socialists.  The nordic system is not socialism.  Social programs are not socialism, although socialists would love to use ever expanding social programs to bribe their way into power and then create crises to gain power permanently.

I live in Kansas. I have no shortage of people willing--very willing--to talk about why they vote the way they do. I get about an even mix of two sets of responses. The first is from people who are so close to incoherent that many of my Facebook friends actually think they're not real people and are just some troll job designed to make fun of Trump voters, but they're not. They really exist. And what they say is just a toxic slurry of disinformation willfully spread by those with a known agenda.

The second group are quite coherent and intelligible, but much of what they say--like much of what Trump says--is predicated on demonstrably false things. I'm actually not confused at all by those who voted for Donald Trump. I've never really been confused by those who vote Republican. I've spent most of my life amongst them. Voting for Donald Trump was not a meaningfully different act than voting for any other Republican. It was motivated by the same things that any vote for any Republican is likely to be motivated by. Republicans spent a lot of time--some still do spend a lot of time--performing shock and dismay that their party was ""taken over"" by Donald Trump, but he's just a culmination of what they've been for close to a century now. There was no great movement of Obama voters into Trump's camp, despite the popular narrative. The real data shows you that there was a meaningful chunk of Obama voters who *stayed home*, not who voted for Trump.

People vote for Republicans because they believe in the Republican program. Donald Trump was simply a purer and more honest expression of what that ideology actually stands for than any we've previously seen elevated to that level. He rightly intuited that the Republican base was never really interested in globalization or free trade. He saw that what had always motivated them was an anxiety about--as some of them have loudly explained since his election--being ""replaced,"" losing their position as the default mode of society. What had always motivated them was a suspicion that someone out there was getting one over on them, was getting something that wasn't deserved, was cheating the system. And they didn't necessarily have any great moral objection to that, but they didn't like that it was someone else instead of them. They don't mind government handouts, not at all--but they want to be the only ones who get them.

Donald Trump understood what had always motivated a certain kind of person in this country because he was such a person. And because he was perhaps the only man of wealth who had never been allowed into the truly elite spaces of upper-crust society, he had never deluded himself into thinking he was better than them. Instead, he had prided himself on being as vulgar and crass and terrible as the lowest common denominator. He was the people's billionaire. *Of course* they fucking voted for him. They were always going to vote for him.

The question is, why are there so many of them? Why are there more of them now than there were just a couple decades ago? Could it have some connection to the rise of a cable news network and a host of right-wing radio shows that are unashamedly devoted to delegitimizing the mainstream press and muddying the waters of what's true, therefore making it much easier for people to retreat into their pre-existing biases? And isn't it noteworthy that this network, and these radio shows, proliferated *immediately* after the elimination of the Fairness Doctrine, the deregulation of media conglomerations, and the rollback of various other measures designed to combat the spread of misinformation in mass media, even though they unarguably were also infringements on absolute free speech?

Plainly, you’re advocating for the elimination of dissent whether you are cognizant of it or not. Look at the difference between the first couple pages of politics compared to the_donald and earnestly ask yourself which one seems to be in the business of radicalizing people with sensationalism. A lot of people who decry the_donald have their entire argument suspended in a straw man, such as yourself. If you hate Trump, fine. Doesn’t matter. That’s your right. But at least be honest about the reasons that you want it to be shut down. You don’t want it removed because it’s a hate group; the amount of seething vitriol and hatred coming from the average user on default politics subs is absolutely disturbing. Do you care about that?

I am a libertarian/classic liberal. I have been told to impale myself, hang myself, told not to vote, that I should be wiped off the planet, etc. *just because of my political opinion*. I have been banned from most default news subs for trolling with no explanation, just from dissent. I have never “trolled”. Of all the disgusting remarks I’ve ever received on this site, **not a single one occurred in the_donald**. It happened in default news subs. In the two years I have lurked (then started to participate) in the_donald, I have *never* seen anything even close to that. 

That is why so many people end up staying there after they check it out for themselves. They go there for entertainment, like an episode of Jerry Springer just to see how crazy some people are because everyone says it’s a group of racist, good for nothing bootlicking idiots. Then people see with their own eyes that’s completely false. Not only is it false, it’s normal people of all backgrounds who have found themselves united in Trump’s message (united in being American/patriotism) because they feel like either their party forgot them or they’re tired of constant identity politics and political correctness tearing everyone apart.

&gt;We were having a break and my libshit colleagues got into an argument regarding immigration. One of them claimed that it's an economic issue and that we should admit anyone in this country because ""they're just trying to make money and support their families"" while the other braindead dipshit had a strong stance that we should let everyone come in because it's basic human right.

&gt;&gt;I couldn't fucking stand it anymore.

&gt;I asked them both, so that everyone present could hear me, if the immigrants want to have strong economy and basic human rights then why don't they work and achieve them in their respective countries of origin instead of coming here?

&gt;Now the entire company is incoherently yelling at me and I'm laughing at them. They want me to fucking apologize for saying that. I think I'm gonna get fired.

&gt;EDIT:I actually managed to make the situation worse. By a lot. Everything pretty much died down when some guys from upper management appeared to see what the ruckus is about, I came forward and explained the situation and I was asked (again) to apologize for saying that and hurting their feelings. And so I did, I apologized. I apologized by saying that I'm deeply sorry that Andrew and Ethan got their feelings hurt by my remarks about immigration and that if they love diversity and multiculturalism that much I will be more than happy to financially support their effort in immigrating from America to Zimbabwe where everyone is diverse and non privileged. Shit was bad. Now it got hysterical. I'm so getting fired, that part is not fun. But I still can't stop fucking laughing. I think I'm losing it.

&gt;EDIT 2 :I escalated the situation to the point where some of the female colleagues started crying. One of the managers told me he's giving me one more chance to remedy the situation by declaring myself as a non Trump supporter and to find the way to make Andrew and Ethan not angry with me. I told everyone at the office that I have perfect people just for that. Their names are Pajeet and Rasheed, the Indian Java developers who can't tell a difference between a class and a method and they can't really grasp the concepts of polymorphism and encapsulation, but that's perfectly fine because they're non white and that Andrew and Ethan can spend some time checking their privilege while diverse people do their job for 10% of their pay. I also told them that rejecting Rasheed and Pajeet would be illegal because they're Israel's exports. And as far as Trump goes I told them I never actually supported the guy, I was just forced into voting for him because I don't think a woman that drinks blood of dead kids she raped with her witch friends and supports her rapist husband should have any say where our military should fight and start wars. The office is almost dead silent now. You can hear occasional sobbing.

&gt;EDIT 3:I was asked to take the rest of the day off and come back Monday. The management wants to discuss the situation. I need to take a break from Voat.

But I don’t, really, anymore. Not on net. I lived through the ’00s, the rise of blogging, those hopeful and naive times when it seemed like the Web would be the ultimate democratizing force, allowing a greater breadth of self-expression and helping the best ideas rise to the top.

That is not how things have turned out. The Web was *too* successful. Where communities used to be based on physical proximity, making different kinds of people spend time together and share a common interest, now more and more people’s main community is online, with people already similar to themselves. And those communities are Petri dishes, whose members become more and more like themselves, *too* much like themselves.

When it was just email forwards in the late ’90s and early ’00s it was bad enough, but with Twitter and Facebook and Reddit it’s just entirely out of control. And Slack and Discord are almost worse, because there the radicalizing happens out of public view.

And *all* the communities are radical in their own way. Flat-earthers, anti-vaxxers, t_d chuds and Chapo Trap House commies, feminists and MRAs and rationalists and milquetoast centrists, all of them are too much like themselves, to the exclusion of other personality types, and getting worse every week they spend with each other online.

You say that as if the reason I ""don't like"" people like Donald Trump and Rodrigo Duterte is that we disagree about which kind of eggs are the tastiest. I ""don't like"" them because they are authoritarians who present a threat to their own countries and to the rest of the world. I ""don't like"" them because they are advancing policies and programs which measurably make their countries, and the rest of the world, more dangerous. I ""don't like"" Donald Trump because his agenda is one that will cause more death and suffering than his opponent's would have caused.

&gt;why

Because I'm bored, I'll go ahead and pretend that you're asking this in good faith even though your username makes it very clear that you aren't. The answer is that no one likes to admit that their entire worldview is wrong. And at this point, these people have constructed an entire worldview out of shit like InfoWars and NaturalNews and Gateway Pundit. (I say ""these people"" but I'm aware there's a reasonably good chance you're one of them.) Admitting you have been wrong, not about one thing or two things but about everything, is *extremely* hard for any person to do. Admitting that you have catastrophically failed to understand the world is extremely hard for any person to do. And a person is only going to be able to do it under extraordinary circumstances, the threshold for which will vary from person to person. But that threshold is not reachable when the network of lies remains constant.

Perhaps if you could get these people out of their InfoWars bubble and detox them for a week, you'd have a shot. But you can't do that. Any voice that disagrees with their narrative is drowned out by the voices that affirm it.

And I follow some of those random sources you list. InfoWars isn't really what you think of it. It's not actually that different from other right-wing talk radio in 2018, like Rush, Savage, Hannity, Levin, etc. Alex even appeared on Savage's show the week he was banned, so they're more inter-connected than you think. The MSM makes it sound like it's always trans-dimensional vampires, but that's just a style of delivery he does. The main content is news commentary. I remember him from when I was a child, so back then, he was actually doing stuff on hard conspiracy content, like the Rothschilds, Build-a-burgers, Trilaterals and CFRs, etc., you know, your dad's stuff, but he moderated a lot at sometime between 2010 and 2015 or so, since when I picked it back up and tuned in occasionally after Trump went on his show, I was surprised at how much he had actually professionalized his message. You may not want to hear that, but I grew up my entire life with conspiracy theories being fringe entertainment, at best, so sorry if it raises red flags when people actually start trying to censor and conspire against the conspiracy theorists. That's not normal.

And, no, I'm not even a conspiracy theorist. Just a right-winger rofl. Sorry for having the wrong political beliefs.

I sincerely think the real reason he was banned is that he disproportionately appeals to the millenial and zoomer demographics. Although I don't have demo data for this, I am a millenial, and a lot of his fans in the content creator community tend to skew millenial and younger, rather than older. It makes sense, since his competition's audiences are simply just going to die off sooner.

The way you're talking is so hateful and dismiss of a huge share of the population, just think of how you would feel if we were talking that way about you. It's a basic human empathy thing. You have things that you like. You wouldn't want anyone to ban them. But other people like different things. You shouldn't try to ban things you don't like either. That's not what America is. For most of our existence, the First Amendment wasn't just a suggestion, it was an ideal. An actual value we all strive towards, to live our lives that way. Tolerate people with different opinions than you, that used to be civics 101. And worst of all it's never even effective. It doesn't matter how many billions of dollars you have, you'll have to literally throw us in jail or concentration camps like the Europeans do, since otherwise humanity finds a way and all censorship eventually has workarounds. You just might slow it down a little, but you also might accelerate it when you piss a critical mass of people off. Which, by the way, you have, when you have US presidents delivering speeches about freedom of speech on the internet at his rallies.

Well my point is that actually it's *not* why we're at where we're at. That such men, and such spaces, have always existed. What has changed is that we refuse to stop amplifying them and giving them a prominent platform. Not that long ago, ""Nazis are bad and should be shunned"" was such a universally accepted premise that they were the obvious default bad guys in Indiana Jones movies. The Blues Brothers memorably committed vehicular assault--and maybe vehicular manslaughter, depending on how you read the final car chase segment--against American Nazis and everyone thought it was funny.

Put that in a movie now and just watch the furrowed-brow thinkpieces about the degradation of civil discourse roll in. *That* is what changed. We started being apologetic for shunning these people. We let Republicans work the refs until things got so bad even *they* were uncomfortable with it. And for every single one of these people we let back into polite society, for every impressionable young mind we allowed to be corrupted by their wickedness, a person of color got the message that America did not give a shit about them, and that voting in the election was pointless.

It is quite reasonable for me to worry about being locked in a cage someday if liberals get their way.


&gt;By the way, I don't feel alienated from society at all. I don't even feel alienated from Kansas. I believe in society, I believe in community, I believe in the nation-state as a potential force for good, I believe in the power of culture to make positive change. I'm happy that I live in a society.

Did it, though? Let's map out those years on one issue as an example. We could map it out on many issues, but let's just pick one to start with. From 1788, the year the U.S. Constitution went into effect, to 1865, black people were considered 3/5 of a person and could legally be owned. It was not ""letting people come to their own conclusions"" that ended chattel slavery in America. It was a civil war. Even if you're one of those kooks that claims the American Civil War was fought over some other issue, you surely will stipulate that the precipitating event for the end of slavery was, in fact, the war. It was not the result of a societal debate.

Then, for the next couple of decades, the people who believed in racial equality tried to effectuate it via legislation, regulation, and rational argument, while those who did not believe in it waged a campaign of racialized terrorism until finally they battered their opponents into submission. They were aided in this by the fact that ""the crowd"" continued to believe that black people were inferior. Those who believed in racial equality were actually a very small minority among whites, even in the North.

Then, for 80 or 90 years, black people lived as second-class citizens. In large swaths of the country, they were functionally denied the right to vote, to own property, to start a business. There is a great deal of scholarship on this, and I'll assume you're aware of the history of Jim Crow. Now black people, and a few white people, made impassioned pleas over this period of time to the effect that segregation was wrong and that all people should be treated equally before the law. But for nearly a century, their arguments failed to persuade ""the crowd."" In fact, when segregation was officially outlawed by the Supreme Court, and then further legislated against by Congress and the President, there was still not a clear majority of the electorate in favor of integration. White people famously reacted with violence and riots, and not just in the South. That's ""the crowd"" again.

Now you might argue that, eventually, ""the crowd"" got it right. Eventually, ""the crowd"" sorted out right from wrong on this issue. But in the interim, there was a great deal of real human suffering. That might be hard for you to empathize with, but I think you ought to try anyway.

When we talk about political disagreements, or disagreements over the facts, we are not talking about trivial matters. Politics is not trivial. Politics is life and death. Everything that a political body does is a matter of life and death. That doesn't mean we should legislate acceptable opinions. But we must see the spread of disinformation for what it is. Disinformation kills. And ""the crowd"" has never demonstrated any aptitude for spotting it.",False

And depending on how loose your definition of Nazi is, the confederate flag has been used by military units in all of ours, was on the Dukes of Hazard and was used by Lynyrd Skynrd (*Freebird, Sweet Home Alabama*), which is hardly Nazi or racist given that it was played at virtually every bar or bah'mitzvah I was invited to in New York.

&gt;The Blues Brothers memorably committed vehicular assault--and maybe vehicular manslaughter, depending on how you read the final car chase segment--against American Nazis and everyone thought it was funny.

Well, that's sick, if true. I don't remember that part of the movie, but you're laughing at dehumanization to the point of ""it's okay to murder someone"".

Look, it's just that no one wants to live in a United States where communists are banning nazis. The only viable solution for our *own physical safety* is a balance of power, since leaning too hard to one extreme or the other is how you and your family end up in a death camp or a gulag.

And I must stress, that murkiness can result from perfectly good intent. For example, Canadian PM Trudeau was recently photographed at a town hall that was not quite half full. The CBC's photo was from the side, and it appeared to show the PM as the centre of an adoring crowd. A Toronto Sun shot was from the back of the hall, making it appear more empty than it was. Each shot was honest, and not Photoshopped, and yet would lead to two different impressions. Multiply that by a million other events elsewhere, each intersecting and interfering with or reinforcing, a million other events, and the murkiness alluded to appears. 

The word 'truth' does not apply here. Both photos alluded to above were true in every sense of the word. Each would be accepted in a court of law without question, where the lawyers would spin the impressions. And it is those impressions that are the real issue. 

We now live a significant portion of our lives in the cybersphere. It is the 100-eyed Argus writ large, allowing us to peer intently and deeply into every aspect of each other's lives, and sites like Reddit facilitate it. One question is, can our society withstand that level of scrutiny? 

But another, more important question concerns virtual communities. Napoleon was said to have understood the grammer of gunpowder; Trump understood the subtext of Twitter. *Pace* McLuhan, the Twitter medium was the message, as it subverted the traditional power brokers of TV and print, and allowed direct and instantaneous communication between candidate and voter. It didn't matter what any single Tweet - the 'content' in McLuhan's terms - contained; it created a brand new communication path that allowed information to flow freely. In the same way that Netflix obviated Blockbuster, and Amazon busted bookstores, Twitter both reduced the importance of the ""MSM"", and allowed the frictionless birth of new tribes, now as simple as saying ""#M2"".

My concern is trivially determining via the API whether or not something is exists / has existed, is private, banned or quarantined, and getting some information about it.

My basic concern is that right now, the API is ""lying"". There's a nullable boolean value called ""quarantine"", and the three states ought to be true, false and null (banned).

Short points:

1) Religion is widely considered a choice, and has always been a protected class. Your view is contrary to the law.

2) I see no reason why this ""choice"" thing should matter, especially surprising from those who call themselves pro-choice.

3) There is actually significant scientific evidence that your political beliefs aren't truly something you ""choose"", but rather something more akin to sexual orientation and gender identity. There's evidence that your political views are accurately predicted by your ""big 5"" personality traits, which are essentially outside of your control, as well as strongly heritable from your parents.

&gt;Why is reddit allowing hateful echo chambers

Because what you think is a hateful echo chamber is different from what I think is one. There is no objective standard and if Reddit goes around banning communities because they're trying to censor certain viewpoints then they potentially open themselves up to litigation or regulation if someone is able to establish that they're acting as publishers and not as a platform. 

Quarantining is the correct *business* decision as it limits Reddit's exposure to liability from users, advertisers and/or regulators. ",False

Six of one, half a dozen of the other.

&gt; The way you're talking is so hateful and dismiss of a huge share of the population 

I'm glad I'm effectively communicating my feelings toward those who have abandoned all hope of a better society and seek only the destruction of everyone you hold responsible, while utterly failing to see who really fucked them over to begin with.

&gt; just think of how you would feel if we were talking that way about you. 

You are. Maybe not you individually right now at this moment, but have you checked in on your subreddit today? Or, you know, ever? Have you watched your news channel? Have you listened to your talk radio shows? I know you have, because you mentioned it in this comment. I watched the way your kind spent eight years talking about everyone to the left of Genghis Khan. I grew up among your kind. I know how you talk about people like me, because you've never been shy about doing it right to my face. Please don't pretend otherwise.

&gt; It's a basic human empathy thing. 

I empathize with the suffering of any working person, and work every day of my life to build a society that is not constructed around grinding people up until they die. I do not need to have a scintilla of affection or respect for people who believe demonstrably wrong shit in order to work towards a better world for them to live in.

&gt; You have things that you like. You wouldn't want anyone to ban them. But other people like different things. You shouldn't try to ban things you don't like either. 

You continue to misunderstand my argument. Part of me thinks it's willful, but part of me thinks you, and other conservatives, really can't get your heads around it. My position has nothing to do with what I ""don't like."" This has never been about ""offensiveness."" People on the left have always been willing to offend, and they remain willing to offend. This is about recognizing that actions, including speech, have consequences. No right can be absolute, because an absolute right necessarily provides for trampling someone else's rights.

I'm sure the sovereign citizen idiots didn't *intend* for their speech to directly incite someone to blow up an office building in Oklahoma City, killing hundreds of people including small children. If they wanted someone to do that, if they believed that doing that would be a force for social good, they'd have done it themselves. But how could it *not* have led to the bombing of the Murrah building? How could anti-abortion rhetoric *not* convince some small number of people to kill doctors in their churches and homes? How could racial dogwhistling for decades *not* ultimately lead to Donald Trump running and winning on a platform of open racial grievance?

&gt; For most of our existence, the First Amendment wasn't just a suggestion, it was an ideal. 

No it wasn't. It wasn't an ideal for the local governments that sanctioned the murder of civil rights activists all over America. It wasn't an ideal for the officials who sicced the police and the Pinkertons on union organizers. Free speech has only ever been an aspiration in this country. It has only ever applied to part of the country, never to all of it.

Should I have the power to quarantine r/news and r/politics for spreading these lies and hoaxes? 

See, heres the rub that you and those with your mindset just aren't getting. Just because *you* believe something is the truth or a lie, doesn't necessarily mean that it *is* a truth or a lie.

You might indeed think Kavanugh is a rapist. That doesn't make it true. You might think Trump is a racist. That doesn't make it true. You might think that someone who refuses to believe in white privilege is a supremacist. That doesn't make it true. You might think that someone who thinks the wage gap is a myth is a misogynist.

Never really felt that way. They weren't championing the wars that killed my cousin.

&gt;I'm glad I'm effectively communicating my feelings toward those who have **abandoned all hope of a better society and seek only the destruction of everyone they hold responsible**, 

Why do you feel so pessimistic about us?

&gt;while utterly failing to see who really fucked them over to begin with.

Why hate us then - how are you not guilty as well? Aren't you taking your anger out in us instead of ""who really fucked us over""?

Why be spiteful?

&gt;You are. Maybe not you individually right now at this moment, but have you checked in on your subreddit today? Or, you know, ever? Have you watched your news channel? Have you listened to your talk radio shows? I know you have, because you mentioned it in this comment. I watched the way your kind spent eight years talking about everyone to the left of Genghis Khan. I grew up among your kind. I know how you talk about people like me, because you've never been shy about doing it right to my face. Please don't pretend otherwise.

 Both sides have problems, yes. I've believed this ever since my Ron Paul days. Shouldn't we try to do better and overcome that? Why do you believe I was saying only ""da libruls"" are like this? I grew up in opposition to the religious right, so I've seen both sides of it. And I make a great deal of effort to reach out to people on the other side of the fence and try to have something come productive out of it. Sometimes it's worth the effort. 

Maybe your experiences with other people like me have been bad, but can you believe I'm different? I just listen to what I listen to because it entertains me, and I agree with it... It's not that complex. It doesn't mean I'm in an unpoppable filter bubble, it's because I don't like those is why I argue against censorship. I want there to be more porosity in society.

&gt;I empathize with the suffering of any working person, and work every day of my life to build a society that is not constructed around grinding people up until they die. I do not need to have a scintilla of affection or respect for people who believe demonstrably wrong shit in order to work towards a better world for them to live in.

Why do they suddenly become not working people when they believe demonstrably wrong shit? Do you realize how creepily communist that sounds? Like Orwellian style. Don't you think working people are more predisposed to believing wrong shit, for obvious reasons?

&gt;You continue to misunderstand my argument. Part of me thinks it's willful, but part of me thinks you, and other conservatives, really can't get your heads around it. My position has nothing to do with what I ""don't like."" This has never been about ""offensiveness."" People on the left have always been willing to offend, and they remain willing to offend. This is about recognizing that actions, including speech, have consequences. No right can be absolute, because an absolute right necessarily provides for trampling someone else's rights.

So now you're actually saying repeal the First Amendment? Why do you think we'll ever allow you to do that?

&gt;I'm sure the sovereign citizen idiots didn't *intend* for their speech to directly incite someone to blow up an office building in Oklahoma City, killing hundreds of people including small children. If they wanted someone to do that, if they believed that doing that would be a force for social good, they'd have done it themselves. But how could it *not* have led to the bombing of the Murrah building? How could anti-abortion rhetoric *not* convince some small number of people to kill doctors in their churches and homes? How could racial dogwhistling for decades *not* ultimately lead to Donald Trump running and winning on a platform of open racial grievance?

Dude what the fuck?

&gt;No it wasn't. It wasn't an ideal for the local governments that sanctioned the murder of civil rights activists all over America. It wasn't an ideal for the officials who sicced the police and the Pinkertons on union organizers. Free speech has only ever been an aspiration in this country. It has only ever applied to part of the country, never to all of it.

These ideas are in fact grounded in well-established science around trauma. When someone has experienced a trauma, they can experience real and serious psychological harm from having those memories triggered without warning. This can happen with any trauma. War veterans famously can be triggered by sounds or sights or other sensations that psychologically put them back in combat. Rape survivors can be triggered in similar ways. Any survivor of any trauma is at risk of this, and it can do real damage.

The ""safe space"" is designed to be a place where a trauma survivor can let their guard down and be sure that triggers have been removed. It is frequently an integral component in coming to terms with a traumatic experience.

A ""trigger warning,"" on the other hand, is what you do when you are *not* in a safe space. When you know you cannot create a safe space, but still want to be compassionate towards trauma sufferers. So, for instance, a college professor might issue, before beginning a discussion of *To Kill A Mockingbird*, a trigger warning for sexual violence and racial violence.

That's it. That's all they are. The concept of the ""safe space,"" *by its very definition*, rules out the idea that anyone could seriously propose turning ""all of planet Earth"" into a safe space. Safe spaces and trigger warnings, like political correctness, are attempts at creating a more compassionate society, a society of people who make small but meaningful efforts to not ruin someone else's day. It will forever mystify me that conservatives are so infuriated by such attempts.",False

But the rest of the American right wing was. Let's abandon the pretense that your politics are driven by non-interventionism. You voted for the guy who said he wanted to ""bomb the shit out of em.""

&gt; Why do you feel so pessimistic about us?

Because I live among you. Given that you live in New York and I live in Kansas, I know more about how your ideological fellow-travelers live and think and believe than you do.

&gt; Aren't you taking your anger out in us instead of ""who really fucked us over""?

Not at all. I don't do a damn thing to you. My life's work is to dismantle and replace the systems that are built on the backs of working people.

&gt; Why do you believe I was saying only ""da libruls"" are like this? 

Because of the words you used, in sentences, which made it clear that you were saying that. Fine, you recant that assertion, whatever.

&gt; I grew up in opposition to the religious right, so I've seen both sides of it. 

And yet here you are, voting for the exact same people they vote for. We all grow up to become the thing we despise, don't we?

&gt; Maybe your experiences with other people like me have been bad, but can you believe I'm different? 

It actually doesn't matter to me. I'm sure you can be very nice and kind and gentle and all the rest of it in person, with the people in your life. Conservatives in general hang their hats on that, in fact. ""Some of my best friends are black,"" don't you know. But it actually doesn't really matter, on the grand scale, if you're nice to the extremely small group of people who exist in your personal bubble. What matters is what you vote for, what you work for, what you attempt to bring into being. There is no personal kindness that can outweigh what you have voted for. Only voting for its opposite can absolve you of that.

&gt; It doesn't mean I'm in an unpoppable filter bubble, it's because I don't like those is why I argue against censorship. 

Perhaps you're not. Or perhaps that's only what you think. We all like to think of ourselves as independent freethinkers who could and would change our views on a dime if we were presented with compelling evidence. But none of us really are.

&gt; Why do they suddenly become not working people when they believe demonstrably wrong shit? 

They don't. How is that what you got out of that? I thought I was being quite clear: I don't have to like every working person to work to build a better world for every working person. It's like we're speaking a different language or something.

&gt; Don't you think working people are more predisposed to believing wrong shit, for obvious reasons? 

No. They are as capable of receiving an education as anyone else. The American right wing has worked very hard to deny them an education, but they are quite capable of learning. They are human beings. As a rule, we're good at learning.

&gt; So now you're actually saying repeal the First Amendment?  

No. I'm saying the First Amendment has been understood to have limits for a really long time. ""Yelling 'fire' in a crowded theater"" is not something I made up; it's from a Supreme Court decision outlining the necessary limits of free speech.

&gt; Dude what the fuck?

I wish I could tell you, but without more information I remain in the dark as to what you find confusing.

&gt; Fuck, for fuck's sake, why do I always get pegged as the crazy person for watching Infowars?

See, now you're almost making me feel bad for reporting you. This is a good example of why I think censorship sucks. You made a throwaway comment that I think is shitty, but you showed self-reflection when I pushed back on you with facts, and seem to be an open-minded enough person that at least you're willing to have a human conversation to me. That to me is just bants. You've treated me much better than people who are able to intellectualize and construct arguments and walls of text, but only use it to keep arguing the same points dishonestly or put me down, no matter how hard I try to get through to him. Censorship always only hits the people who fuck up and violate the obvious rules while the people who are able to adapt, update their arguments or be truly emotionally manipulative, those tend to be the real people you have to watch out for on social media anyway. 

I'd like to believe that I'm one of the more thoughtful people with these views that I've come across. For a libertarian, I've done a pretty deep dive into this stuff over the last few years, since it became relevant, but I also grew up with Jews; my moral values as well as my unique upbringing seems to be enough to allow me to confront these ideologies while keeping my humanity intact, at least I think.

And, yeah, to be honest, Sarah Jeong's response was basically trolling against trolls. On an individual level I can't really knock her for that, even with my ethnocentric interests. What I have an issue with is the double standards in enforcement, in social standards that we currently have right now. I guess people could argue that hey, it's always been unfair, so now it's your turn, and honestly, we probably deserve it and it builds character, but I'm a young guy and I've only ever known this. It went from ""nagging feelings"" when I was a kid in high school, thinking the curriculum was weird, to blossoming like a flower into this.

I'm just a guy who's weirded out by a lot of the shit he sees right now, which I understand is the case for a lot of people all across the political spectrum.

Why can't I talk about racism in general and focus on whites? Well, I would say, because I'm white, and a lot of other people talk about other racisms, because I think is important, but I think our voice is silenced compared to our share of the population, and those who do speak are either truly evil or portrayed to be as such. So I try and commit myself to demonstrating to people that not all of us with points of view similar to mine are some kind of monster. I'm still a libertarian, which keeps me moral, and I have extensive personal experiences growing up with Jews, who obviously factor pretty central into this kind of worldview. The two of these together have given me a kind of thoughtfulness and level of empathy that I think maybe is rare for fans or followers of the movement. I wouldn't identify with ""the movement"", all the way, and keep myself at arm's length, but I've followed it for several years out of personal interest, out of a fascination as much as anything else, and I think I've cut through the bullshit and have a pretty good idea of the grievances they have, which are obviously grievances I share as a white man. I don't think it's fair to say that categorically none of us should be heard, no matter how we present ourselves.

I'm not claiming many of the subs were innocent (braincels, Cringeanarchy for more recent major examples), but quite a few of the recently hit subs were quite civilized or at the very least mature enough to mind their own business. The alt right is scattered and doing a piss-poor job at regrouping themselves. All they've left is T_D and DebateAltRight and the rest of them are tiny bootleg communities that spawned after the fall of subs like MDE.

The ball is very much in the admins' court. They're currently rooting out as many far right subreddits as they possibly can, which would be fine. My problem is that the alt left counterparts of the alt right subreddits that are being shagged are allowed to be left up, subs that say equally fucked up crap. Maybe they are going to get to those after they're done with the far right, bust I honestly doubt it.

As for Fullcommunism, I took a peak and as far as I could tell it was just a crappy meme page with the occassional Stalin apologist, not exactly what I'm talking about. 

The reason people are screaming censorship is because of the constant shit alt right subs have to go through just to exist while equally horrible alt left subs barely receive any punishment at all. Now, this comment is already longer than I wanted it to be so I guess I'll just leave it at that.

So, let me see if I have this right: a white woman wants to annihilate all white people? Am I reading that correctly?

&gt; Roseanne saying Valerie Jarret's ugly hers got cancelled. 

I think you know that's not what got her canceled. She didn't say Valerie Jarrett is ugly. She said a black woman looks like a monkey. That's a very specific form of racial abuse with a long and well-documented history.

&gt; And then when you have Obama giving speeches saying ""How hard is it to condemn Nazis"" when he doesn't condemn Antifa 

Antifa activists are far less likely to have endorsed Obama than Nazis are to have endorsed Donald Trump. Also, antifa activists are not calling for ethnic cleansing and genocide. So, you know, there are some differences there.

&gt; the subtext is pretty much yeah they are Nazis, kill them. 

That's not the subtext. Do you think that ""condemn"" is a synonym for ""kill""? Also, why does anyone's opinion have Nazis have anything to do with you?

&gt; Why are you saying hate speech has to be censored but literally killing people should not. 

I'm not saying that. You've somehow worked yourself into this state of mind where you're just randomly assigning nefarious ulterior meanings to things that Obama and I have said. It's kind of weird, man.

&gt; Also Sarah Jeong.

Yes, Sarah Jeong is also a person that exists.

&gt; Also outright discrimination based on our race.

What discrimination? I've been white for 32 years, haven't been discriminated against for it once.

Well, that seems to have been a miscalculation.

&gt; Declare martial law. I don't care. 

Well look at Mr. Freedom Of Speech over here! It's always just a matter of time before you tell on yourselves, isn't it? You don't give a shit about freedom. All you care about is maintaining a white supremacist country. It doesn't matter if everything sucks, as long as black people have it a little worse than you.

Don't pull that gas lighting bullshit with me. If you can't respond without being dishonest don't respond. 

Here is the only passage from my initial comment which discussed any sort of response to problematic speech. Please point to where I advocated for government censorship: ""At some point, it must become acceptable for us to say that certain people, certain groups, certain entities have proven to us that they cannot be trusted to use their freedom of speech in a responsible way. We must be able to place that which is toxic and has no socially redeeming value outside the bounds of what is acceptable. I don't know if we have to do that in a way that involves the law, but we must have some way of doing it.""

See, to me, that looks an awful lot like I'm advocating for *society* to act on its own behalf. To shun toxic ideas and disinformation and those who peddle them. Maybe it only looks that way to me because I'm capable of both reading and writing complex and nuanced ideas, but I think it's pretty clear.

What you'll hear communists say is ""they deserved worse"", not ""they deserved death"", in reference to a class of people (the kulaks) who literally hoarded and burned food during times of famine (of which there were plenty in Russia before the 1917 revolution), and were punished by being sent to prisons that had *much* better conditions than prisons in the US and other capitalist nations (many got their own house, and up to 500 000 prisoners were released each year). 

So when you see ""they deserved worse"" it's not much different than when a rapist gets 1 year in prison, for example, and people say ""he got off easy"" or something of that nature. 

Secondly, you won't find any of those subs talking about ""the middle class"". That's a term used by Liberals, not Marxists. In Marxist analysis, there's the working class, or the proletariat, and the ruling/ownership class, or the bourgeoisie. 

What most liberals consider the middle class would either be known to communists as working class or petty bourgeoisie. Not one of those subs talk about ""the middle class doesn't deserve to live"". Communists don't even strive to kill the bourgeoisie. All communists strive for is for the workers to own the means of production, instead of people who earned capital through inheritance or exploitation claiming the rights to something that was/is created and operated by workers. No one should own the product of *human* invention, because no *one* person invents something. We all work together to create and innovate, and all workers in an organization should have a democratic say in the operation of the organization, and society itself.

&amp;#x200B;

I agree that freedom of speech is important in terms of truth and justice, but there will always be limitations beyond slippery slope arguments that are necessary in upholding those same principles. There's a reason why books about holocaust conspiracy theories are not in the WWII History section of a given library. It's because they are demonstrably and verifiably false. You can still find those works, they are just not granted the same shelf space.

The reason why this has always been the case ever since the advent of stores of information is because not all information is equal. We should all have access to it, but it should not and has never been advertised as equally important.

So keep those areas of free speech in their own quarantined corner, freely available to all with the disclaimer that it is widely known as being horse shit. Don't put Joe Anti-Vaxx's theories on the same shelf as a medical publication which has been around for generations, which subjects itself to much more rigorous standards, spent countless resources in an exhaustive unbiased delve into that same subject matter. Don't put Adolf Jr's horseshit cherry picking account of the holocaust next to works which thousands more hours were put into getting as accurate and unbiased accounts of the atrocities as possible. Don't allow terrorist groups like ISIS to spread ridiculous propaganda which radicalizes thousands of young people on the same platform as you give to the people who champion individual liberties, peace, and equality.

We’re focused on behaviors and how we can incentivize positive behavior by all our users. 

Make no mistake, I understand and even, to some extent, support when certain subs are quarantined, for example r/wpd. As long as users like me can still access them, as long as there is no blatant censorship. I also don't want to people ""accidentally"" would come across a gore or similar sub. Check.

However, I think your reply here is dishonest. This is strange since further above you actually said exactly the reason why they're quarantined, it's for protecting your ad revenue, and that advertisers won't jump off. MOSTLY. (This is not even meant sarcastically. It is simply what it is, since websites need to generate revenue. I am not naive.)

But when I read you saying ""we want healthy communities"" I cringe. Because if it wasn't for advertisers, you know there would be no reason to ""quarantine"" a sub whatsoever. There would be no reason to quarantine a sub ""for healthy communities"", respective the absence of a quarantine, say as previously (again I am giving /wpd as an example) did in no may mean or add to that the sub was ""unhealthy"".

The same with your (to me) strange mentioning of ""positive behaviour"", which somehow implies to me that a quarantine is some sort of punishment for a ""badly behaving sub"", whatever this may mean.

Again let me give watchpeopledie as an example. Do you think the sub is not ""behaving positively""...or that the fact that the sub shows deaths is something ""not positive"", simply due to what the sub is about, which IMO is fully legitimate in its own right, but of course ""not for everyone"". However, there is no ill-fated intention or any ""bad behaviour"", now from how I see it.

I tend to think of things from terms of group interests--who's interests are being served. I belong to a group who's interests are NOT being served, who in effect has no representation as it has essentially been declared that our interests are illegitimate and that there is an ""inevitable brown future"" in our own country and who is in effect being ethnically cleansed by government policy which I was not allowed to vote against in a supposed democracy.

This is not true with the *distribution* or *posession* of cp after it has been produced.

Law enforcement has been known to possess and distribute such content as a means of targeting the producers and distributors of this content.  Is that an inherently abusive act?

&gt; Criminalizing the sharing of pornography allows law enforcement resources to be allocated to targeting producers and distributers of child pornography.

Murder is criminalized, but videos of murders are not.  Does this make it harder for law enforcement resources to be allocated to targeting murderers?

It is possible to believe that child abuse is wrong and still criticize the legal framework surrounding CP.

My own view is that strict legal liability for the position of digital data is fundamentally dangerous to free society.

Consider thesimilar situation of drug posession, it’s known that police officers will sometimes take advantage of this strict liability to frame people (usually minorities) by planting evidence.

With drugs, at least their ability to do so is somewhat limited by the quantity of contraband anofficer has at their disposal.

This is not the case with contraband that can be infinitely replicated at near zero cost.

I don't really care about the existence of this sub because, in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't do much. But nobody should say it's ""just another sub"". It has nothing in common with the porn subs you listed (which highly objectify women, but that's a different topic).

There is a nuance between the two. Just because the supremacists of /r/whitebeauty don't post anything vulgar or offensive (although their comments are something else entirely, you should read some of them) doesn't mean they aren't ideologically motivated. There is nothing racist in recognizing that different skin colours exist, and the porn subs you listed don't glorify the existence of the race, they're just wank material of a particular kind. In that sense they have more in common with other porn subreddits about particular sex acts than /r/whitebeauty.

And I'm sure regulars will now flock to my comment and tell me it's all just a joke and I shouldn't take it seriously. Yeah, sure, it always is a joke. Talking about an Aryan übermodel was just a bait. But why isn't any post in /r/asiancuties or /r/EbonyPorn titled like this?

Please, tell me how your government is more democratic than mine, I'm from the Netherlands, but I would also be fine with a comparison to any Western European government. 

If you are talking about undemocratic hate speech laws, my country has a few, but they have not really been used except for the trials against Geert Wilders. While I am no supporter of Wilders, I do not like these trials at all. It does, however, not make my country undemocratic or even anything close to that. In fact, we have more press freedom than the USA (Ranking 3rd, the USA ranking 45th [link](https://rsf.org/en/ranking)), and are ranked higher in the Human Freedom Index (9th, USA 17th [Link](https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/human-freedom-index-files/2017-human-freedom-index-2.pdf)), as well as the US-made Freedom in the World survey ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_in_the_World#Country_rankings)), where my country still gets the highest score while the US fell a little below since last year. Yeah, you have guns, great. I can vote for someone that doesn't work for some big company, and actually make sure I won't need them.

In addition to all these things, the US has a serious corruption problem in both politics and the media. Yes, newspapers and television are sometimes a bit tilted to one side of the spectrum here as well, but nowhere near the amount it is in the US. Our political system is also not perfect, but at least with multiple parties the parties are inclined to collaborate instead of just throwing mud. It is absolutely horrendous that you have been brainwashed in such a way that you think your country is the only free country in the world, while it is being consumed from the inside by corruption. I fear the same might happen at some point here as well, but for now, you are the one in the sinking ship.

&gt; ""Free Expression"" is only protected by the constitution for existence in public spaces. Private entities, such as Reddit, don't have to give a fuck and can limit expression of whatever views you hold with impunity.  
u/Le_Tricky states a fact. While the fact here goes with the censoring narrative, it ultimately remains a revelant fact to the debate. Reddit can censor users as it pleases.

&gt; Concurrently, if you're arguing that views such as casual racism, easily falsifiable conspiracy theories that are essentially libel, and propaganda meant to incite anything from animus to real-world violence have a place at the discussion table,
u/Le_Tricky then states an opinion. that is to say, Reddit censors hate speech and misinformation. You can comment on this, because opinions are debatable. TRP was censored, but TD wasn't; why would you save this group and throw the other down the pit? This is just an obvious example; plenty more exist.

&gt; then we'll just seat you at the kids table so the grown ups can be productive. 
u/Le_Tricky ends his post by stating another opinion: when you want to have a constructive and meaningful debate, when you want to evolve as a community, then hate speech and misinformation have to be censored and eliminated, because they are ultimately hurtful, and that the time spent debunking and defending oneself is time that is not spent on more pressing matters.

Free speech and keeping this platform free even to fringe and offensive content is important and worth in my opinion it isn't in the admin (and yours) opinion.

So they eventually have more and more people going away (sadly because there are subreddits i enjoy here) and reddit himself will become more and more an echo chamber for a techentusiast/urbanite/leftwing/malebutnottoomuch crowd..

That's what you sound like.

First off, you're the one who put words in my mouth. Nobody and nothing gives you the goddamn right. 

Second of all, I love free expression. It gives me the right to call neo-Nazi and misogynist views scum and chastise those who propagate it. 

Third, I did mention constitutionality *before* you decided to grace this thread with your presence, so you arguing that I wasn't referring to that is idiotic at best. 

Fourth, Reddit can ban whatever the fuck they want to ban. They own the site and the app that you use to engage on their platform. If you don't like it, then leave.  4chan would love you.

Fifth, you don't get to trot out the idea of ""free expression"" and white-knight all over this discussion because that's not even what it's about. Reddit, unlike your imagined Libertarian fantasy world, has site-wide rules.  Such as those concerning targeted harassment, doxxing, and real world threats. These quarantined subs have repeatedly violated any/all of these rules and the mods did nothing to reign it in (because they almost certainly support it). So Reddit issues them warnings that they have to stop breaking rules, otherwise they will take action against the community. So stop acting like you either 1) understand what this quarantine move was about or 2) actually give two shits about free speech just to try to take the moral high ground. You fool nobody. You're just upset because your favorite radical batshit-crazy sub is just one more click away and demonetized. If you want a safe space to be an ideological extremist, then go make one for yourself. Since you use Reddit, you play by their rules. And if you deem that ""unfair"", then I won't even waste my breath trying to explain the concept of ""fairness"" to you. ",False

However, what I'm seeing now is that the personal opinions of the Reddit admins determine what subs get quarantined, and not some legal line in the law. Blatant racism is obviously unwanted. Anything that violates local laws, advocating for harm etc. is obviously unwanted.

The problem is that 'feelings' are now apparently also a qualifier. If a sub offends someone, it gets quarantined. Subs are getting quarantined and banned left and right based on nothing but some vocal majority being offended and not liking the opinion of that sub in general. Even if the content itself isn't illegal in any way, it's the sheer fact that someone doesn't agree that is enough to get a sub in trouble.

To name some examples, having different opinions on genders isn't illegal. Yet some subs that are critical of the whole LGBTA alphabet soup spectrum are being quarantined or even banned. Based on what, exactly? Some group of people feeling offended by it and demanding the admins take action against an alternative opinion on a subject?

TRP's quarantine is another example of this. Discussing the sexual mechanics between men and women isn't illegal. But because it touches on a controversial point of view that some people don't agree with it gets quarantined.

It's 2018 and there are entire movements out there that will get offended at just about anything. These are people who will get mad, offended, feel personally attacked and will demand that everything that does not fit their world view is censored and removed. But being offended does not make you right or even justified in feeling that way. I, for one, am deeply offended by horses. If I can get a couple of hundred people to proclaim their hate of horses along with me, will Reddit's admins quarantine /r/Horses? After all, you wouldn't want it

&gt; accidentally viewed by those who do not knowingly wish to do so

Point is this, and this goes out to Reddit admins and all the special snowflakes complaining about things that offends them:

You can disagree with someone's opinion all day long. But the second you want to silence someone for having a different opinion than you, you are literally no different than the worst regimes and governments the world has known in history. If Reddit proclaims itself to be open and diverse, then censoring content based on the opinion of a vocal minority is the entirely wrong direction to go in.

So if I say I support the October Revolution and Lenin, along with the beginning of the Soviet Union before Stalin, it means I support famines and deaths?

&gt; I love my country, but it doesn't mean I love it's government or the actions it has done

So what's your support then? It's culture? It's ""freedom of speech"" that protects pro-genocide agendas? It's multiple wars in the Middle East against people who had no involvement, yet is buddy buddy with the country that shelters members of ISIS simply because that country supplies our oil? 

&gt; Communism has created more evil then the U.S ever could

The genocide of the local Indians killed thousands of people for Manifest Destiny. Your country profited from the selling and owning of slaves, and had to go to war over your right to own humans. Your government has it's little grubby paws over every nation in the world, and has created multiple insurgencies and rebellions in countries that were doing fine on their own. Your government puts right-wing dictators in control of countries like Chile, overthrowing democratically elected leaders and creating even more genocides in the process. 

You funded ISIS and other terrorist groups in the Middle East to fight off the Russians, yet expect sympathy when those same terrorists come to your home and wreak the place. The U.S is the entire reason they were able to operate there and kill American journalists and innocent civilians. Places like Iraq were good places with progressive values until your government funded a rebellion that clouded them in the dark ages of burkas and forced child marriages. You've been fighting a war for 14 years and drone bomb weddings and hospitals, but you don't care because you're isolated in a bubble of consumerism and the next new thing, while your own brothers and sisters starve and die because they couldn't afford their own medicine.

Your country is fucked. Stalin was a terrible man who directly went against the dreams of Lenin and Marx, and turned the Soviet Union into a authortian nightmare. Your country has been corrupted by the dark spectre of capitalism ever since it's inception. If the rich had no rules, they would enslave you within a day.

e6sn58g,e6skg90,announcements,-1,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",2018-09-28 13:37:03,1330,"&gt; First off, you're the one who put words in my mouth. Nobody and nothing gives you the goddamn right. 

You saying exactly what you said gives me that right. I didn't invent an anti free-expression stance for you, YOU did that as you typed one out. Don't pretend for a second.

&gt;Second of all, I love free expression. It gives me the right to call neo-Nazi and misogynist views scum and chastise those who propagate it. 

Demonstrably it doesn't since you're doing so on a platform which you yourself admitted is under no obligation to provide free expression, and which you have praised for curtailing it. You even made a snarky quip about how the types of speech you don't like should literally be segregated away from public discourse.

&gt;Third, I did mention constitutionality before you decided to grace this thread with your presence, so you arguing that I wasn't referring to that is idiotic at best. 

But u/GAMER_GIRL_POO didn't mention constitutionality, did they? They mentioned that you support limiting free expression, and you segued into constitutionality in the form of a non-sequitur. You mentioned it only to defer away from the accusation, which you then bolstered through the rest of your comment.  
So when someone accused you of celebrating limiting others free expression, your response amounted to ""Yes I do, but I'm allowed to"". Which doesn't refute anything they said.

&gt;Fourth, Reddit can ban whatever the fuck they want to ban

Which is again, a total non-sequitur. Yes, they can. They can also shut the site down tomorrow or turn it into a furry porn forum. That's entirely irrelevant discussion. ""They shouldn't do X"" is not countered when you say ""They CAN do X"". ""Can"" and ""Should"" are different things. Did you not know this?

&gt;Fifth, you don't get to trot out the idea of ""free expression"" and white-knight all over this discussion because that's not even what it's about.

Sure as fuck seems like it, given that curtailing free expression is the entire issue with this course of action, and the ideals of free expression are what Reddit was founded on.

&gt;Reddit, unlike your imagined Libertarian fantasy world, has site-wide rules. Such as those concerning targeted harassment, doxxing, and real world threats. These quarantined subs have repeatedly violated any/all of these rules and the mods did nothing to reign it in (because they almost certainly support it).

Correct.  
The issue then becomes that these rules are selectively enforced. Where is r/inceltears , since they engage in harassment and doxxing as an integral part of the sub's existence? I notice r/fragilejewishredditor is on there, so where is r/fragilewhiteredditor ? r/FULLCOMMUNISM is up there for calls to violence, but it seems when r/latestagecapitalism makes posts calling for revolution and to kill the rich, that's fair game?  
Stop acting like this is purely rule-enforcement. We all know it's a partisan purge, and you pretending otherwise only highlights your support of such an action whilst knowing the optics are bad.

&gt;So Reddit issues them warnings that they have to stop breaking rules, otherwise they will take action against the community

That's funny, because r/cringeanarchy did exactly that: Removed rule-breaking content. They were warned, took action to appease the site admins, and then were quarantined anyway. Sounds like a bit of a virtual Kristallnacht to me.

&gt;So stop acting like you either 1) understand what this quarantine move was about

I understand what it's about just fine, it's the prelude to an outright ban for subs that aren't advertiser friendly due to their political leanings. It's why subs which ideologically oppose the quarantined ones but don't differ in intent or actions remain active, because it's fine for you to make fun of the ""acceptable"" targets like white people or the rich, but it's not okay to do the same for Jewish or homosexual individuals.  
Why pretend this is anything other than a partisan purge? We know which subs got quarantined and which didn't, so don't give me this ""it's just the rules"" shit.

&gt;or 2) actually give two shits about free speech just to try to take the moral high ground.

I mean when did I call for any sub to be banned? When did I celebrate anything being banned or removed? Your projection is palpable, claiming that ""you don't support free speech, you just want to spew your hate!"" you scream while doing the same yourself. It'd be hilarious if it wasn't so sad.

&gt;You're just upset because your favorite radical batshit-crazy sub is just one more click away and demonetized.

But I thought The_Donald was the ultimate radical sub, and they're still here!  
Does that upset you? Doesn't it hurt to have just claimed that admins are applying rules, in the same thread which began because a user called out the admins on not affecting a sub which ""routinely breaks the rules""? Does this hypocrisy know no end to you, or are you fully aware of it but honorbound to play along?

&gt;If you want a safe space to be an ideological extremist, then go make one for yourself

Fair call. Lucky for me, the far-right is currently in the process of making ""reality"" that extremist safe-space. So I guess I can take some solace in that.

&gt;Since you use Reddit, you play by their rules. And if you deem that ""unfair"", then I won't even waste my breath trying to explain the concept of ""fairness"" to you. 

As I said in my very first comment: ""Limiting others free expression is okay if daddy corporation tells me it is!""

&gt;  Exactly, they disagree about it. Who the fuck disagrees about a fuckhead RUNNING someone over? 

You didn't follow what I said. I haven't talked to anyone who defends him as a moral good person.

The disagreement is about what happened.  Some people say he intentionally drove into the crowd to hurt leftists.  Many point out that he probably wouldn't have known the crowd was leftists, and he likely could not see the car that was stopped in the middle of the crowd.

Furthermore, people point out that there were people attacking his car with sticks, and he appeared to brake multiple times.

Furthermore, there is a contemporaneous internet post bragging about chasing him off by brandishing a rifle.

Also he was schizophrenic, and I believe off his meds.

Some people believe--and I think this is credible--that he's a mentally ill person who made a bunch of bad decisions trying to flee the event once shit got too hot.

&gt;Fucksake, this is a human life were talking about.

Yeah, there's a schizophrenic idiot who is entitled to a fair trial.  On the left, they call him a terrorist, despite there being a bunch of evidence that calls that into question.

This is the key fallacy and danger of this entire way of thinking.

**Everything** must **always** be up for debate.

Doubt is the very bedrock of civilization. Everything we have achieved as a species has been driven by the realization that our understanding of the world is limited, our conceptions frequently flawed, and our achievements imperfect and never realized to their fullest potential.

The hallmark of an advanced culture is one that welcomes questions, not simply of the wider world but also through internalized examination of its own flaws, failings and inconsistencies. 

Even in the most precise fields of science we are constantly uncovering entirely new mechanics which shift our understanding of the very foundations of reality at the smallest and grandest scales imaginable.

Within the sociopolitical sphere 'truth' is far more malleable and has been shown countless times throughout history to be very easily distorted by governments who manifested a firm control of their bureaucracy and media, along with an utter disregard for these self same fundamental values of open discourse.

The suggestion that ""our government is better than that"" only rings true when strongly worded, passionate debate can be freely shared on any subject. In our current climate of increasing criminalization of 'Hate Speech', ideological and corporate policing of social networks, Sesame Scores, and political correctness, any further move toward restricted expression should rightfully be viewed as a dangerous infringement of civil liberties.

Certainly, as a private business Reddit is not beholden to the public good and has no ethical obligation to uphold what is best for society at large. However, in the same way, it should not be allowed to pass off censorship in service to its market value, as a moralistic crusade to protect us from ourselves.

I actually enjoy reading odd offensive shit more than anything, not because I condone it, but because it's interesting to see and because being offended is a valid method to find out what your own opinion on controversial matters are.

Seen those too. Again a handful of downvoted comments and obvious jokes.  And No doxxing at all. 

Do you not think it odd that you dont verify or loom into this shit on your own? That you rely on strangers on reddit to think for you? To give you your opinions? 

Why dont YOU give them a look-see. Or better yet, actually hang out on TD. See for yourself what kind of content is on there. And not just a few chereypicked posts that could have been (and likely were) posted by the very person compiling them. 

 I havent seen any doxing or calls to violence. Ive probably seen plenty of propaganda but I see that everywhere. I mean mediamatters is all over r/politics and that's david brocks new prooaganda outlet. Like, actual propaganda. Not just a website with a domain registered in Russia.

I think the reason the left is so scared of propaganda is because they themselves just acceot everything theyre told uncritically so they assume that must be true for everyone.

To play devil's advocate for a moment reasons for banning T_D could include:

Brigadeing of other subreddits

That guy they encouraged to kill his father who then went and killed his father

Encouraging of Doxxing

Organized abuse. The admins banned fatpeoplehate for less than what happens on T_D daily

Advocating for genocide

Racism. Pretty much everyone from the banned coontown sub (I may be misremembering the name) seems to have blocked to T_D

Illegal activities. T_D is a haven for Russian propaganda

Spreading misinformation (for example, as stated in this very announcement post, I've seen ""the Holocaust is a hoax"" perpetrated on T_D by many users)

To be clear, I'm playing devil's advocate here. I don't believe T_D should be banned, it should be quarantined.

Second comment:

I'm going to make a bet that someone with the username LONGLIVEDONALDTRUMP probably isn't the most unbiased source here.  

But sure, here's sources:

[The T_D user who killed his father for calling him a Nazi and was encouraged by T_D users.  Admittedly I just grabbed the first article on the subject I found.  I also am unable to find the specific instances of where he was egged on on his profile but it appears his comment history has been largely removed.](https://www.thedailybeast.com/youtube-trumpkin-and-former-milo-intern-kills-his-own-dad-for-calling-him-a-nazi)

[Conveniently his profile does give proof of my other claims.](https://www.reddit.com/user/seattle4truth/) [Here he is spreadding misinformation that CNN is ISIS or at least in league with ISIS which is laughable.](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6lygsb/cnn_is_actually_isis_network_correspondent_worked/) 

[Here he is spreading that because a black comedian made a joke all of Hollywood hates white people.](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6la7t2/damon_wayans_jr_wishes_america_a_happy_white/)

[The Huffington post hates white people and wants to start a civil war.  Propaganda, racism, misinformation, inciting violence home run.  Comments are sexism, calls for violence against women, calls for violence against non-whites, threats that the alt-right will win the so-called ""civil war"", and other forms of racism.](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6l9r5z/look_how_much_huffcompost_hates_white_people_and/)

[A post supporting racism against people who spell correctly for some reason.](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6l7939/life_lesson_4597463223_never_trust_anyone_that/)

[Russian propaganda being spread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6kk3ao/wikileaks_julian_assange_warns_of_twitters/)

[More Russian propaganda being spread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6hlaml/breaking_russia_claims_to_have_killed_cnns_ceo/)

[Inciting violence against blacks and claiming a civil war has started.](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6hivp6/shots_fired_at_trumpsupporting_truck_in_indiana/)

[Russian propagagnda](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6er24x/andrew_therriault_worked_with_seth_rich_at_the/)

[Russian propaganda](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6ej0xn/seth_rich_wasnt_the_only_person_the_murdered_in/)

[And yet MORE perpetuating of Russian propaganda.](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6djjrx/they_just_deleted_seth_richs_panda4progress/)

So, the only things I didn't find in scraping this guys account are direct orders to doxx sites (though that was implied by some of them) or to brigade other subs.  This guy has been in prison for over a year.  And what started the fight that led to him killing his father?  He was ""out of control"" spouting ""things from the internet"" and claiming that toddlers could consent to sex when his father called him a Nazi so he killed his father.

""left-wing people"" takes too long to type. ""Liberal"" is false.  and if you're in the streets mobbing a car, i think ""leftist"" is close enough.

He didn't know her.  He didn't know she was there.  Saying it's because he didn't agree with her politically is exactly the type of narrative crafting that makes you sound like a virulent tribalist.

I'm not making excuses for anyone.  I'm disagreeing with the narrative you learned from people who have an interest in a narrative. When you say ""shot up a pizza parlor"" you're repeating propaganda.

I do the same thing when I talk to conservatives, btw.

The best thing reddit could do would be to bring back r/reddit.com or a similar official catchall that only applies reddit policy, and maybe restricts nsfw content.

A place for meta debate and mostly unrestricted political discussion.

Instead of attempting to enforce community standards on 1 million subreddits; they should focus on getting one decent public space right, and leave moderators be elsewhere.

This approach does not impede on existing communities, it creates a public space for the sort of cross-ideological discourse we desperately need.

Reddit describes itself as similar to a federal system of government.  But it's a government of a ""nation"" with effectively no public spaces.

The closing of r/reddit.com has made the rest of the site incredibly divisive, and restoring it is the biggest step reddit could make to connect diverse perspectives in a meaningful way.

&gt;there are some things that are either verifiable or falsifiable and not seriously up for debate (eg, the Holocaust did happen and the number of people who died is well documented)

The mainstream point of view is given by the Jewish Virtual Library here: https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/documenting-numbers-of-victims-of-the-holocaust It says:

&gt;Calculating the numbers of individuals who were killed as the result of Nazi policies is a difficult task. There is no single wartime document created by Nazi officials that spells out how many people were killed in the Holocaust or World War II.

&gt;To accurately estimate the extent of human losses, scholars, Jewish organizations, and governmental agencies since the 1940s have relied on a variety of different records, such as census reports, captured German and Axis archives, and postwar investigations, to compile these statistics. As more documents come to light or as scholars arrive at a more precise understanding of the Holocaust, estimates of human losses may change.

Is a reddit as a whole now against the mainstream point of view? Why do you disagree with it so definitively?

I think the main problem that crops up in these echochamber subs is that once a narrative is established, any posts that criticize or poke holes in that narrative are nuked off the sub by a combination of heavy-handed/ban-happy mods and hyperactive radical users who organize to quickly mass downvote. This prevents newer, not yet radical users from seeing any dissenting information on the subs in question. Instead they get fed a constant stream of whatever tripe the sub is about, and the slow slide into madness is pretty much guaranteed.

Reddit has been trying to tackle this by using various strategies like quarantines to force subreddit mods to be more even-handed and stop misusing their ban and remove powers, but I still see this as only solving half the problem. Once an echo-chamber sub gets established enough, and gets enough dedicated users, they are capable of enforcing the narrative in the sub without assistance from the sub's moderators.

My suggestion is for the admins to go a step further, and to have quarantined subs ""lose the downvote priviledge"". That way, a hivemind of radical users will not be able to bury all critical posts on the sub. Even if they're surrounded by highly upvoted kool-aid, a typical user browsing the sub would still be able to see critical or disagreeing posts fairly regularly. 

Doing this would also encourage redditors from outside the sub's insular community to engage and make more of these critical posts. Like, right now, even though I know T_D is a terrible echochamber full of easily refuted propaganda, I don't go post there because I know nobody will see my comment and I don't want to eat the downvotes. If I knew I could go post critical comments there with the ""risk"" of being nuked with downvotes, I'd be much more likely to do so. Other redditors are probably similar. This alone could massively help the wider reddit community self-police these radical communities.",False

A few things about that study:

1. While it looks well-sourced, there are a few places where sources aren't provided, yet arguments are build on top of them. For example, in page 4 there is a sentence, ""It is clearly the case that racial, ethnic, and homophobic hate speech have well-documented connections to violence and discrimination in the real world."". There's no citation on this claim.

It's then followed by, ""Nonetheless, in this context, we feel that the term “hate speech” is a more accurate description of the content of r/fatpeoplehate than milder alternatives such as “offensive speech” or “abusive language.”"" which is in the context of ""An open question is whether this definition of hate speech pertains to body characteristics such as “fatness;” the definition presents a list of such characteristics (minorities, migrants, etc), but it does not stipulate that this list is exclusive."" What's happening is they are extending the definition for the purpose of the study and batch it together. It's degrading to people with issues that are out of their control. Fatness, on the other hand, very often isn't out of person's control. They seal the deal by stating that ""In contrast, r/fatpeoplehate focuses exclusively on denigrating fat people as a group."" Since hate speech by their provided definition (later they mention in page 6 that there isn't a universally accepted definition of hate speech) implies attacking a group of people, they attribute the same attacks to fat people.


2. They focus on keyword analysis, which has an inherent weakness: you will only look for these words and not more complex things. They mention that they are aware of this issue and it ""presents a long-term challenge"". Nevertheless, this is the preferred methodology. They then tested the system on similar subreddits to obtain baseline data.

3. They then split the study into two parts: pre and post ban windows, each being 10 days long and they compared the activity levels of affected users. Initial findings showed that, ""we found no significant evidence that the observed
decrease in posting volumes of treatment (both FPH and CT) was caused by the ban (p-value≈ 0.637
for CT users, and p-value≈ 0.897 for FPH users). In other words, the decrease in treatment posting
activity in Figure 2 is closely mirrored by the control, reflecting a deeper, underlying pattern
unrelated to the ban."" In other words, the volume of comments decreased but it seems unrelated to the ban.

4. They then did a keyword analysis of users affected by the ban. ""We analyzed over 2.5 million posts by treatment CT and control CT users, and over 13 million posts by treatment FPH and control FPH users. They depict decreases of at least 80% in treatment groups. However, in order to confirm that these decreases were due to the ban and not
some underlying, site-wide decrease in hate-speech behavior, we employ a difference-in-differences analysis as a robustness check."" They know that in order to actually see the results, they'd have to scrape all of Reddit. Instead they basically compared keyword frequencies of affected and control groups. 

5. They then tracked where users, who didn't delete their accounts, went to. They concluded that usage of their chosen keywords by these users decreased by 80%

6. At the end, they say "".Though important, there are still many hate communities on Reddit that we have not explored. [...] we do not know the exact date at which a Reddit user account was abandoned, nor the exact reason behind the termination of an account. For instance, it could have been the case that a particular account was a “throwaway"" used temporarily by a user [25]. We do not account for such things in our current work [...]""

Basically, within the scope of the study (2 hate subreddits and migrant destination subreddits, a list of very specific 20-23 keywords, and a list of users of hate subreddits) they concluded that it helped. While it's a start, it's MUCH too early to claim it worked, which is what the Techcrunch article is all about. Users are much more nuanced, there are many other subreddits, that haven't been looked at (some might be set to private [speculating about it]), used language might have changed. Moreover, there are 2 other critical issues:

1. How do you know that these users were organic? The study doesn't talk about outliers that contribute significantly more than others. There always are outliers and they must be identified. What do I mean by organic? I run a PR business and I've been approached by people to help them sway specific discussions not only in Reddit but in other platforms. Very often you have a handful of users contributing the most to the conversation. Goals are different, but are not limited to inciting hate or sabotage. How do we know this isn't sabotage?

2. The study doesn't talk about the total amount of new users after the ban and what kind of users are they. Since the list of subreddits in question is very limited in scope, the reality might be very different once accounted for.

All and all, I'm very skeptical about this study. I don't give a shit about definitions or people spewing hate (whatever that means). I care about the research and its implications and I care about the fuckery of extending definitions for the purpose of the study.",False

Cool, they have something in common with feminism.

Absolutely not true. More equality between both sexes benefits both, that's the point I tried to make. 

&gt;What you're describing is activism for Humanity as a whole, which has a name: HUMANITARIANISM. 

Humanitarianism and feminism are linked, since feminism is a branch of humanitarianism. 

&gt;Odd that an activist group exclusively meant for women's rights would pseudo-adopt a Humanitarian viewpoint to help bolster their own exposure while still touting ""Power Economics"" and thinly masked misandry, all the while championing rights for ""ALL PEOPLE"". It's almost like it's something new entirely... Like it's... NEOFEMINISM.

Meh, all a fiction. Humanitarianism didn't do squat for women until feminism did there thing. 

&gt; Feminists are there for women, Neofeminists are there to skree about how they hate men while saying men are welcome in their group, and HUMANITARIANISM is there for HUMANITY. Get over it.

That is fucking racist. Are those powerful enough words for you?

Also let's talk about assuming someone's lived experience because I am, in fact, a white person who spent several formative years in a majority Latino community. My school was mostly Latino, and with still a slight edge of black students to white. 

But you know what was amazing? My teachers were still white. The councilmembers were majority white. The mayor was white. The police who patrolled my neighborhood and harassed my neighbors were white. And this is not the outlier in America - this is the norm.

To play devil's advocate for a moment reasons for banning T_D could include:

Brigadeing of other subreddits

That guy they encouraged to kill his father who then went and killed his father

Encouraging of Doxxing

Organized abuse. The admins banned fatpeoplehate for less than what happens on T_D daily

Advocating for genocide

Racism. Pretty much everyone from the banned coontown sub (I may be misremembering the name) seems to have blocked to T_D

Illegal activities. T_D is a haven for Russian propaganda

Spreading misinformation (for example, as stated in this very announcement post, I've seen ""the Holocaust is a hoax"" perpetrated on T_D by many users)

To be clear, I'm playing devil's advocate here. I don't believe T_D should be banned, it should be quarantined.

Second comment:

I'm going to make a bet that someone with the username LONGLIVEDONALDTRUMP probably isn't the most unbiased source here.

But sure, here's sources:

The T_D user who killed his father for calling him a Nazi and was encouraged by T_D users. Admittedly I just grabbed the first article on the subject I found. I also am unable to find the specific instances of where he was egged on on his profile but it appears his comment history has been largely removed.

Conveniently his profile does give proof of my other claims. Here he is spreadding misinformation that CNN is ISIS or at least in league with ISIS which is laughable.

Here he is spreading that because a black comedian made a joke all of Hollywood hates white people.

The Huffington post hates white people and wants to start a civil war. Propaganda, racism, misinformation, inciting violence home run. Comments are sexism, calls for violence against women, calls for violence against non-whites, threats that the alt-right will win the so-called ""civil war"", and other forms of racism.

A post supporting racism against people who spell correctly for some reason.

Russian propaganda being spread.

More Russian propaganda being spread.

Inciting violence against blacks and claiming a civil war has started.

Russian propagagnda

Russian propaganda

And yet MORE perpetuating of Russian propaganda.

So, the only things I didn't find in scraping this guys account are direct orders to doxx sites (though that was implied by some of them) or to brigade other subs. This guy has been in prison for over a year. And what started the fight that led to him killing his father? He was ""out of control"" spouting ""things from the internet"" and claiming that toddlers could consent to sex when his father called him a Nazi so he killed his father. Yeah, T_D is just the sweetest place I'm sure.

End of comments

So yes, T_D meets criteria not just for quarantining but also for banning. We'll never hear from /u/spez
, /u/landoflobsters
, or any other admin why they won't do either though.

I have to disagree with this.  The Cobra effect isn't relevant here; its a description of an accidental outcome, not a process by which it might occur.  The Streisand effect is a process, but it might not apply in this situation.  

The Streisand effect works precisely because it makes something unique and thus interesting.  However, if the quarantine covers enough different content, no single topic will be unique enough for the Streisand effect to have a major effect.

For instance, the question isn't whether you should hate those people, but maybe Who are these people?

A well defined group....somewhat ""People who are in favor of genocide?""

But the more you drill into it the more it comes a question of what does ""in favor"" mean. Also are we including people who associate with people who are ""in favor of genocide""?

Maybe for myself it's a matter of who someone chooses to hate. 

Because when one says ""A Nazi"" there's a million different interpretations of what that is.

In the most traditional sense it would be the people in germany at the time of the holocaust. But these new people who call themselves? Neo-Nazis, or support hitler or whatever. These are different people with different goals.

ah. there was a misunderstanding, I think.

&gt;Because your stupid hypotheticals and devils advocate nonsense represent an existential threat to what gains have been made in civil rights over the past 60 years.

Most people making these points were effectively just looking for excuses to be racist. I'm sorry if that's how it came out. At this point you may very well not believe me, but still, I apologize.

&gt;All of those things I listed earlier are statistical realities. They are well documented. That is the real sort of oppression that just one group faces to say nothing of the varied types that affect Indigenous people and women and LGBTQ+ and Hispanic communities. 

absolutely

&gt; These are actual problems and you want to talk about fictional white people that may be living under the yolk of a hypothetical black hierarchy.

ah, you got me wrong. I was actually talking about a theoretical white person living among black peeps that, because they are ghettoised and disrespected in the white country all of this hypothetical scenario takes place, turn their anger (which is justified) against a scapegoat. This is not racist per se, I don't believe racism against white people would exist in a white society. However, it is still opression, albeit on a very, very small scale. Opression bh the opressed, if you will. I wanted to illustrate that hate begets hate. I can't blame the hated because they hate; however, I can blame the racist system, which tips the scale in favor of whites and white cities in terms of wealth, infrastructure and education.

Now, I can quote an actual example, instead of a theoretical.; incels. I believe, and feel free to discuss this, that incels as a community are the direct byproduct of gender expectations placed unto women and men by our patriarcal society. They don't feel like they're adequate because of the impossibility to attain men's standards of virility; however, *these standards are vital to the patriarcal society*. The ones that are to rule and dominate **cannot** be weak or otherwise ""womanly"" for any reason. Therefore, those who are not will lock themselves away from society. The patriarcal society hurts everyone (arguably more women than men, but the point is; everyone would benefit from a society where individuals are treated as equal in regards of gender, color, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, disabilities, and I probably forgot some.).

What I wanted to demonstrate (and what was misunderstood) is that trying to hierarchize suffering and opression, and negating other's experiences is never a good idea (I mean look at where terfs are now, it's weirdly hypnotizing) if we want to achieve social advances. If you cut the source (racism, patriarchy, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, etc), then the consequences will eventually fade. (admittedly easier said than done.)

&gt;That is fucking racist. Are those powerful enough words for you?

I can't believe I'm actually typing these exact words, but I'm sorry if that's how it came out.

&gt;Also let's talk about assuming someone's lived experience because I am, in fact, a white person who spent several formative years in a majority Latino community. My school was mostly Latino, and with still a slight edge of black students to white. 

&gt;But you know what was amazing? My teachers were still white. The councilmembers were majority white. The mayor was white. The police who patrolled my neighborhood and harassed my neighbors were white. And this is not the outlier in America - this is the norm.

and that's a clear sign of a dysfunctional society

&gt;So get fucked with your hypotheticals and your what-ifs wrapped in a veneer of false civility that masks nothing but at the very least a deep seated indifference to people who don't look like you.

This isn't the practical world, it's a pseudo-anonymous internet forum.

It's not a strong crypto-anarchy, but from the perspective of the user-base it is quite similar especially as it relates to this property:

&gt; A crypto-anarchy [is] a community where the threat of violence is impotent because violence is impossible, and violence is impossible because its participants cannot be linked to their true names or physical locations.

Knowing someones physical identity is a necessary precursor to violence.

Rigorous and focused enforcement of doxing rules and user education/tools are the necessary, best approach to prevent violence from arising from reddit.


&gt; Should they allow communities where you can hire someone for murder?

No, see dox rule.

&gt; What about child porn?

No, the government would shut the site down.

See: https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/pmj7f/a_necessary_change_in_policy/

&gt; What if certain subs are recruiting grounds for radical muslims or white supremacists or violent gangs?

Violent gangs like r/protectandserve and r/fullcommunism?  I don't think we should play favorites.  Their capacity for actual violence via reddit is tempered to the extent that reddit remains anonymous.

&gt; What about a sub with the main purpose of doxxing random people just to make their lives miserable?

Nope,  See doxing rule and my full endorsement and justification for it.

&gt; But unless you truly want to allow anything and everything, which is a terrible idea, then you have to draw a line somewhere.

Fair enough, I think this was a pretty good line and a pretty free speech place:

They literally increased the quotas Ukrainian farmers were expected to hand over in 1932 even as production slowed down. Anybody who couldn't meet these inflated quotas had to then give up **15X their quota** (obviously not possible) to avoid being put on a blacklist, which meant Soviet authorities would take literally everything they could find from your farm, would not send aid, and would shoot you if you tried trading.

&gt; Snyder lists seven crucial policies that **applied only, or mainly, to Soviet Ukraine.** He states: ""Each of them may seem like an anodyne administrative measure, and each of them was certainly presented as such at the time, and yet each had to kill"":[55]

* From 18 November 1932 **peasants from Ukraine were required to return extra grain they had previously earned for meeting their targets**. State police and party brigades were sent into these regions to root out any food they could find.
* Two days later, a law was passed forcing peasants who could not meet their grain quotas to surrender any livestock they had.
* Eight days later, **collective farms that failed to meet their quotas were placed on ""blacklists"" in which they were forced to surrender 15 times their quota.** These farms were picked apart for any possible food by party activists. 
* **Blacklisted communes had no right to trade or to receive deliveries of any kind, and became death zones.**
* On 5 December 1932, Stalin's security chief presented the justification for terrorizing Ukrainian party officials to collect the grain. It was considered treason if anyone refused to do their part in grain requisitions for the state.
* In November 1932 Ukraine was required to provide 1/3 of the grain collection of the entire Soviet Union. As Lazar Kaganovich put it, the Soviet state would fight ""ferociously"" to fulfill the plan.
* In January 1933 **Ukraine's borders were sealed in order to prevent Ukrainian peasants from fleeing to other republics**. By the end of February 1933 approximately 190,000 Ukrainian peasants had been caught trying to flee Ukraine and were forced to return to their villages to starve.
* **The collection of grain continued even after the annual requisition target for 1932 was met in late January 1933**.[55]",False

You don't need to lie about what your movement is if it can hold water by itself; if Feminism is Feminism (Female Rights, as demonstrated during Suffrage) then it can't claim to be Humanitarianism, its roots are already too deepset in history (a history that rejected true equality in favor of more gyno-centric perks).

Humanity needs Humanitarians, not Feminists. It just comes across as WOMEN fighting AGAINST MEN/THE WORLD for all rights, which is what it started out as. You can't change the definition of something just because pretending to be inclusive brings in more money, if you change the definition (the goals) then you change what it's called.

Banning /r/the_Donald doesn't fix that problem, it just means that reddit as an ADMINISTRATION is censoring, rather than a subreddit as a community. /r/the_Donald is one of many subreddits, being banned from them doesn't mean you can't voice your political opinion elsewhere.

Contrarily, if reddit starts banning conservative subreddits, then there is no place for people to discuss or show their support for conservative views.

It's the difference between your neighbor not liking you because you're gay and your government not liking you because you're gay.

Reddit as a platform is about free-speech (I'd argue most of the users don't actually support it, based on every single announcement post being filled with ""ban /r/the_Donald, I don't like conservatives!""), no one is saying subreddits need to be.

People seem to not understand that /r/the_Donald is not a political discussion subreddit. It's a Trump fan subreddit. They love Trump, and they post about how they love Trump and everything he does. You wouldn't go on /r/TaylorSwift and post about it how much she sucks and how she shouldn't have won X award because of Y and how she's ruining music. If you did, it wouldn't be surprising if a moderator removed your post. It goes against the intent of the subreddit.

/r/politics is a political discussion subreddit. It's an echo chamber, of course, but it's purpose is still discussion. That's why conservative views are not deleted. /r/LateStageCapitalism is the best analog to /r/the_Donald. It's a subreddit that is for the support of a specific idea, not the discussion of that idea, they are both circlejerks, and they both like to talk about the beliefs outside of their subreddit (which is perfectly allowed btw, these users are not brigading, they are just users who are passionate about something and also visit other subreddits).",False

In all seriousness, what you're describing is disinformation. You're litterally doing what this whole post is working to stop. Redefining oppression to mean the opposite of what it actually means is a blatant attempt to recontextualize whiteness as vulnerable and moral. If you can get people to believe that whiteness is a moral good then you can get them to believe that they are threatened by diversity and integration. If white people feel threatened by diversity and integration then they can be convinced to take action against their new 'opponents'. That's the end goal: dividing people, inciting violence and sustaining white supremacy. You don't want to end oppression because you know an end to oppression means peace and integration and an end to whiteness as a dominating social force. But you're unable to convince people to outright and overtly enact your ideology because that's not what they want, the people like positive race relations. The other side is already winning. So you've resorted to tricking them into it, carrying out shadow operations, utilizing underhanded tactics, psyops and disinformation.

You don't really know what the left is, do you? CNN, and the rest of the mainstream media, are and always have been the centrist press, with a significantly conservative lean--not in the sense of conservative politics, but in the sense of establishmentarianism and a bias toward including all sides of an issue, even if the issue is a matter of settled fact.

&gt; saying things like ""An inside source told us Trump knew about the Trump tower meeting ahead of time"", then when the source, which surprisingly actually existed this time, says ""It was me and that's wrong"" and CNN lies about him refusing to comment?  

I don't know what you're talking about because I don't watch TV news. It rots your brain. My guess is that CNN issued a correction, but the Gateway Pundit told you otherwise and you believed it.

&gt; Well, doesn't matter how crazy any of that is, guess leftists are unhinged because CNN runs outright lies too. 

You'd have a point if anyone on the actual left watched CNN. What you don't seem to understand is that ""The Resistance"" is a creation largely of the liberal center, not the progressive left. Trump and his followers have enraged the centrist goblins. So yeah, now all of their media organs are responding to the moment. The real left was disgusted with and opposed to Trump long before the mainstream media was.

In Marxist theory, imperialism refers to the ""imperialist countries"" exporting surplus capital (from the finance sector) to the global periphery in order to extract raw materials and other commodities for cheaper than the domestic labor can produce, to sustain the comparatively higher standards of living. It's not formal colonialism, but it shares similarities in how it gets commodities from the colonized nations.

The reason Britain colonized India wasn't just because they could, but because the vast wealth they shipped home from the colonies was actually *required* to build industrial capitalism. Marxists call this process ""primitive accumulation"" of capital.

People deal with the problems they face in life different ways. How you might respond to a challenge might be different from mine. How you might deal with depression might be different that mine.

I say that to say this. I lost my daughter on 10/28/2016. I reached out to people on multiple platforms for help. For advice. For a open ear. For arms to wrap around me. For someone to just fucking tell me it’s going to be ok. I’m not saying the WPD community doesn’t have some cunts in it but it also has some of the most passionate, down to earth, realistic human beings I’ve ever met. I’ve had more conversations about death and the reality of it on this sub than any other plat form I’ve tried using. I’ve had conversations last for days and weeks and have had people check in on me.

I had to live through the horror of feeling my daughter get cold in my arms.. that’s why I am here. To see that the life I’m currently living in, is something that we are all going to have to face.

There is a video on here, and most will know which one I am talking about, it’s the video where the brick comes through the truck window and although you can’t see what happened you hear the husband reacting to it for a solid minute or so. That video makes people cringe and some people say it’s harder to watch than the cartel videos. For me when I hear it, I cry every time. I watch it every time but I cry every time as well. I cry because it literally takes me back to the exact moment where my wife and I found out our daughter died. Those cries of pain and sorrow and helplessness are forever burned into my brain, but they are my wife’s cries that I hear when I watch that video.

Watching stuff like that makes me just understand that someone somewhere knows what I am going through and it comforts me ( in a sick way ) to know that someone else knows the exact pain I feel. I’d rather watch that video 50X then have another conversation of someone telling me that they don’t know how I feel but I’ll be ok, I just need to accept that God wanted a Angel.

All it would take is for a handful of acocunts to upload the text of a bunch of science papers to various subreddits (and movies, and film scripts, and photos, and music) and then aiming a smattering of publishers at Reddit, and Reddit winds up in bankruptcy, being sold to Time Warner.

&gt;Using logic and common sense, not leftist hyperbole - how can you pin one murder by some crazy lunatic on a subreddit of almost 700,000 subscribers with probably even more viewers?

He posted to TD with some pretty racist, tumpist shit, worked for Milo Yanonazi and then murdered his father not because his father wanted him to get a job or move out or go to church, because his worldview was so warped by the company he kept, that his father was seen as the enemy. 

&gt;Do you have any actual evidence of t_d condoning violence or murder against someone or a group of people? Not a single comment, but a thread that has picked up traction openly calling for murder?

Sure, take a look at the [Charlottesville sticked comment](http://archive.is/H4i4G). We really should add a +1 from this archive making the TD body count +2. Thanks for reminding me about the second murder TD has. 

&gt;The paragraph you quoted is literally from the leftist rag that is Vox and serves no credibility at all. 

Yup, few publishers are willing to say something that goes against the trumpist oligarchies, thank the magic sky fairy for Vox. Checked on Vox's reporting and while they are left-leaning, they are highly factual. I'll repeat that because when confronted with facts, the tactics change to whataboutisim or shifting goal posts, 

&gt;Overall, we rate Vox Left Biased due to wording and story selection that favors the left and **highly factual** based on proper sourcing.

&gt;Welcome to the internet. 

I've been here since the late 90's, so thanks? Your condescending attitude actually makes me feel sad for you and how pathetic your life must be that you chose to defend a forum that has been documented promoting violence against anyone who is not like them and actively has a body count. Bless your heart.  

&gt;You're going to find things you disagree with and isolated instances of racism or ""transphobia"". But what Vox considers to be hate speech isn't something a rational person that isn't on the left would consider hate speech so I'm not going to take their word on anything.

Ah so it's not the whole sub, it's only isolated incidents, cool, cool. I'm sure that works when telling the victims family that it's just isolated incidents every time it happens from the same user group from the same sub.

E.g., “Anyone can laugh at anything, who decides what is ‘funny’?” “Anyone can be turned on by anything, who decides what is ‘attractive’?” etc. In fact, with some tweaking, it can be used with pretty much all language—“Anyone can call anything a ‘dog,’ who decides what a ‘dog’ is?” What you’re asking is actually something of a fundamental question in semiotics, and could be rephrased something like, “given the endless number of different ways different people can use the same sign, how can we meaningfully talk about what they refer to?” 

The basic answer a semiotician might give you would be that although any word could be used by a specific individual for any referent, communities of language users are essentially forced, by the pragmatic requirements of communication, to use any given word in such a way that there will be a fairly consistent resemblance between its referents where there is similarity in the context in which it is used. That is, meaning is determined by use in a bottom-up social process.

Congrats Mr. All mighty I really wish I had your stellar intellect to draw such a conclusion.

&gt;Cool, I love debating idiots on the internet who push Russian propaganda and hate America. Oh Well, I'm bored today so why not bite.

Already with the ad hominems and extreme radical leftist terminology like ""Russian propaganda"" and ""hate America"". Look. Once you grow a pair of balls and leave mommy's basement, you'll understand that not everyone that disagrees with is a Nazi or pushes ""Russian propaganda"". 



&gt;He posted to TD with some pretty racist, tumpist shit, worked for Milo Yanonazi and then murdered his father not because his father wanted him to get a job or move out or go to church, because his worldview was so warped by the company he kept, that his father was seen as the enemy.



Again, this isn't TD's fault. It's like saying /r/politics and left leaning propaganda outlets like Vox and yes, Reddit, are the reason the baseball shooter was radicalized. In that case, that shooter *specifically sought out to target Republicans*.

Get your partisan bullshit out of here. He's one user out of millions of viewers. Pinning TD on that murder is beyond fucking moronic and only your retarded leftist friends would believe something with so many logical holes.

&gt;Sure, take a look at the Charlottesville sticked comment. We really should add a +1 from this archive making the TD body count +2. Thanks for reminding me about the second murder TD has.



**I'll ask you again. Show me a single comment which gained any sort of traction or that wasn't removed which advocated for violence or murder. Go ahead.**


&gt;Yup, few publishers are willing to say something that goes against the trumpist oligarchies, thank the magic sky fairy for Vox. Checked on Vox's reporting and while they are left-leaning, they are highly factual. I'll repeat that because when confronted with facts, the tactics change to whataboutisim or shifting goal posts,



What you linked is an *opinion* piece, not facts. But of course you being a retarded leftist with the thinking of a child, you can't differentiate between the two. Vox is tabloid garbage and the way they present *facts* are misleading. Any news organization that specifically go out of their way to push an agenda, not report news, are a propaganda outlet. A news source like AP, NPR, or Reuters are credible. Vox is not and they radicalize you leftists.

Example - https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitPoliticsSays/comments/9itvu6/rpolitics_rationally_discusses_ted_cruz_and_his/

I'm sure you think it's completely okay that a thread which openly shows Ted Cruz being targeted and harassed while trying to have dinner with his wife. The thread inside that link shows a /r/politics thread with 30k upvotes and support for the harassment of senators. It's fucking extreme, and moreover you lunatics support this type of extremism.


&gt;I've been here since the late 90's, so thanks? Your condescending attitude actually makes me feel sad for you and how pathetic your life must be that you chose to defend a forum that has been documented promoting violence against anyone who is not like them and actively has a body count. Bless your heart.


Yes, I can tell you're a college aged millennial. Fucking shocker.


You keep saying they have a body count when you can't link a single comment or thread with any sort of traction that advocates for direct violence, harassment, or murder of political opponents or enemies. I'm not defending t_d, I'm merely pointing out how fucking pathetic it is to claim t_d has a body count. This is the fucking internet. You're pinning one death of a user to a specific community that isn't responsible at all.


&gt;Ah so it's not the whole sub, it's only isolated incidents, cool, cool. I'm sure that works when telling the victims family that it's just isolated incidents every time it happens from the same user group from the same sub. I guess when you grow up a bit more, you may reflect on this period in your life and realize what a tool you were to spread the good word from Russian, through the GOP to random internet users.


I get your failed attempt to appeal to emotions by saying ""think of the families"", but I'm not buying it.

I will do (have done) a lot to help prevent it, walking people home, calling them a cab, being cautinary when someone “creeps me out”, advocating for legal CSW and treating addiction as a health problem (to reduce the profitability and control of traffickers), etc.

I would *never* fault a person for acting in self defense, or someone coming to their aid. If I did intervene, I would do my best to not kill the attacker, but I’d certainly try less hard than say confronting a thief or engaging in civil disobedience. I wouldn’t support the idea that a cop has more or less “authority”, or deserves more legal protections than a Good Samaritan. I’d also suggest the vast majority of what law enforcement does in a jurisdiction has almost nothing to do with violent crime, and may create or contribute the cycles of poverty and abuse which primes the next generation of violent individuals.

I’d also suggest that genocide would be much more difficult without the concentration of wealth and power into states — or corporations, though they tend to at least have some function where they must compete for consumer loyalty, where killing is going to be negative for business, especially in a connected world where it is harder to hide abusive behaviors.

At some point, I think humanity needs to break the cycle of violence and abuse, which I don’t think states are an indeal institution to lead in that regard — but would say societies (or states) that reduce militarism are healthier, even if it just transfers the spending to non-violent, non-enforcement (ideally voluntary) programs.

I think the major difference is the definition of violence and the degree to which a power can increasingly regulate the affairs of individuals within the nation-state. They aren’t putting people in stocks or doing public executions, but putting someone in jail for increasingly unharmful or victimless variations on human behavior is not non-violent either. State jurisdictions are inherently geographic, but the sociocultural norms of the area are far more fluid.

Ultimately, most non-violent state mandates or taxes eventually escalate to capture and incarceration if a person resists. If not wage garnishment, puts an employer in the position of complying with (what I would consider) theft.

I’d also say that nothing happens in a vacuum, and it is always harder to scientifically identify a cause in the social sciences versus physical sciences because there is not an adequate control population for world-wide institutions or systems.

So you admit he's a TD user and since we know he killed someone, TD has a body count. Thanks for clearing that up. 

&gt;I'll ask you again. Show me a single comment which gained any sort of traction or that wasn't removed which advocated for violence or murder. Go ahead.

goes out of their way, and is a propaganda outlet, not are. 

&gt;**A news source** like AP, NPR, or Reuters are credible. 

News sources. 

&gt;Vox is not and they radicalize you leftists.

The projection is so deep here. At least you admit it.

&gt;Example - https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitPoliticsSays/comments/9itvu6/rpolitics_rationally_discusses_ted_cruz_and_his/
I'm sure you think it's completely okay that a thread which openly shows Ted Cruz being targeted and harassed while trying to have dinner with his wife. The thread inside that link shows a /r/politics thread with 30k upvotes and support for the harassment of senators. It's fucking extreme, and moreover you lunatics support this type of extremism.

Remember in my last post I said you'd bring in whataboutisim, here it is again. Also, linking to SPS, a hate sub, does not help your case.

I'm not defending t_d, I'm merely pointing out how fucking pathetic it is to claim t_d has a body count. This is the fucking internet.

&gt;genocide would be much more difficult without the concentration of wealth and power into states — or corporations

It's also arguable that the concentration of wealth and power into states is the main thing that can prevent a genocide. If there were no states, there'd be little to stop a violent group organising. The most powerful and reprobate members of society would become dominant were the ""good"" people not willing to organise in defense of the weak and powerless. If they were willing to organise in that, you might as well call that a state. Tolstoyan pacifism made Russian society ripe to be overtaken by tyrants. The very well known pacifist Vera Brittain argued against British intervention in WW2, which the recent film about her life completely left out since it would make her look like a terrible person.

&gt;societies (or states) that reduce militarism are healthier

Because you are mostly likely white and I'm not white. You want to reign supreme over non-white people like me. You are a supremacist.

&gt; Give actual proof of ""White Genocide"" that involves KILLING all whites people.

Genocide doesn't just mean putting people into gas chambers idiot:

&gt; The United Nations Genocide Convention, which was established in 1948, defines genocide as ""acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group"".
Ceaușescu was trailed and executed for genocide mostly because he created a man-made famine, because he wanted to get rid of the 10 billion USD national debt during the 80's, and how hundreds of millions of people died in Socialist Romania.  

Tens of millions of Romanian orphan children died, and Ceaușescu thought AIDS wasn't real because socialism was so pure or some shit.

&gt; Some children in the orphanages were infected with HIV/AIDS due to unsterilised instruments.[9] Overall, orphanages failed to meet even the most basic needs of the children.[9] In addition to the distress of living in an orphanage, children faced further displacement when they were moved from one orphanage to another, without being told in advance. Usually children had to change institutions first when they reached 3 years of age, and again when they reached 6 years of age. The harshest fate was reserved to children deemed as ""irrecuperable"" who were considered ""unproductive"" and assigned to the Labor Ministry. After the fall of the regime, former staff claimed corporal punishment of all children was practised and encouraged as appropriate discipline, and staff who did not beat the children were considered weak.[7] ",False

Fascism is authoritarian civic nationalism dumbass, the Nazis wanted a socialist economic system for Germanic/Nordic people only. Have you ever read the 25 point National Socialist program?

Look at Richard Spencer, he is half-Jewish, half-British and he advocates for a socialist economy in a white ethno-state. How exactly is he a pro-capitalist, civic nationalist Fascist?

Oh and you claimed that just because I hate atheist Jewish supremacists like George Soros that means I hate all Jews?


Yes, I am claiming Nazi Germany was fascist. The Nazis didn't want socialism for certain ethnicities. Instead they privatized many things, being the capitalistic bastards they were.


&gt;You claim to care about the Jews, except when they are actually real Jews aka religious, and not just a ethnicity? You hate PragerU because you are a Nazi.


So people whose are athiest or something that are descendents of Holocaust survivors aren't Jews? Also, hating PragerU has basically nothing to do with being a Nazi.


&gt;Because you are mostly likely white and I'm not white. You want to reign supreme over non-white people like me. You are a supremacist.


I am not white. I am Chinese. Even if I were white I don't see how it would be possible to be a supremacist and support a black power group. Even the stupid argument of calling me a ""black supremacist"" would be more logical than your's.


&gt;Genocide doesn't just mean putting people into gas chambers idiot:


Firstly, nice job citing the pro capitalist anti communist right wing UN. Secondly, if you are claiming that genocide doesn't require killing to be genocide, then if you are correct, there isn't anything wrong with it. Of course, I am almost sure you are wrong and genocide is bad.


&gt;Tens of millions of Romanian orphan children died, and Ceaușescu thought AIDS wasn't real because socialism was so pure or some shit.

From the top down? Nothing. I, nor anyone else, has the inherent authority to impose anything on another person. No group is superior to any individual. 

I think that the premise is invalid. Anarchy is the natural state. I think the burden of moral/ethical proof is on the party advocating that it has some inherent authority to violate the sovereignty of an individual person. Most people argue that the benefit exceeds the cost, but to me that is a moral black hole. Apart from that, I generally think the world would operate more efficiently and humanely if it’s problems are managed by markets/networks/localized collectives/information sharing/consumer choice on an issue-by-issue/resource-by-resource/provider-by-provider basis over monolithic bureaucratic states.

Some institutions may look capitalist (market-based) or socialist (voluntary pooled risk/resources.) Most anarchists favor one or the other to the exclusion of the other. I tend to favor market systems, but have no inherent objection to voluntary socialism or communism.

Even in democratic societies, there is an idea of the “consent of the governed”, which I think falls far below what I consider the minimum moral standard for consent. Individuals don’t automatically consent to everything a state does merely by existing or being born in a specific location.

Even in self-defense or the immediate defense of person from bodily harm or death is the absolute limit for justifiable force. It is unjust to use violence to achieve some social goal, even if the goal is generally good, or makes desirable metrics rise.

Ultimately, it is the discretion of individuals if they are going to follow the principle of non-aggression. I do have more confidence that individuals will increasingly avoid violent acts without the psychological insulation of “just following orders.” If they reject violence, many other antisocial problems decrease, especially those caused by enforcement efforts/black markets.

Almost everything a state does, desirable or undesirable, is derived from an implicit or explicit claim to the right to use violence and/or coercion. For example, to my knowledge, the National Weather Service has no enforcement function, and I’d argue a weather forecasting service is a good thing. However, if it is funded by taxes, which are collected under threat of theft or arrest, it is an immoral solution to a legitimate social problem. Pruning solutions that require forced compliance and funding leaves voluntary solutions, many of which I’d argue are also superior in terms of efficacy, cost, accountability to stakeholders, etc.

Free riders are a problem, and some people are hopelessly violently antisocial. However, I’d suggest it is ultimately less of a problem, especially as the harmful effects of states and highly concentrated power dissipate.

From the bottom up? Whatever opportunities present themselves that meet one simple requirement. 

1. The directive of one party must not initiate violence or the threat of violence directly or in directly to another person.

If that is met, whether I participate or expect anyone else to, is ultimately their individual discretion. 

The ills are not the same. I can easily concede that. I can say in one regard that I think program A is better/worse than B for purpose C, or that country 1 does a better job of C than country 2. However, I will never advocate for either A or B if they are involuntary, which is to say coercive and ultimately violent.

If C is virtuous, I’ll happily support whatever of options D-Z is most ideal so long as they do not violate the principle of non-aggression.

Drugs are just one of the most aggregious examples to me. I don’t accept that any person or group has a right to regulate what another does with/for/to their own body. I would say that an insurance company may only cover drugs with third party verification of scientific validity as an element of the insurance contract, (the specific point where the patient explicitly consents, until revoked), but that it cannot generally interfere with a person opting to take them (or decline treatment) unless it uses violence (e.g., criminalization/regulation of drugs, involuntary commitment/treatment, “treatments” that are almost identical to prison,...).

I do not think it will be utopia. It is natural order, rather than prescribed order. Especially for outliers, I think it will be far more civil. Generally, I do think it will ultimately be less violent and more liberal than the current system.",False

Where it falls flat is on the practical plane. In short, it suffers the same problems socialism as a doctrine does, a belief in the ""goodness"" of man. This is understandable as both ideas stem from Rousseau's own theory of the social contract, in that it is society that corrupts man.

&gt;Especially for outliers, I think it will be far more civil. Generally, I do think it will ultimately be less violent and more liberal than the current system.

This part here is especially problematic. If you re-read both my previous posts, humanity has been in a state of anarchy for far longer than it has been in a state of ordered society. Violence was far more common the less societies were organized. 

Your non-aggression principle is, in essence, no different than laws. Most people know, both on a legal and moral basis, that they should not kill or harm others. Yet, many do it anyway for a variety of motives. The idea of applying that universal principle to everyone without an effective enforcement mechanism is utopian at best.

&gt; It is natural order

That seems to me like an appeal to nature. Because something is closer to an imagined original state of being does not make it more correct.

&gt;Pruning solutions that require forced compliance and funding leaves voluntary solutions, many of which I’d argue are also superior in terms of efficacy, cost, accountability to stakeholders, etc.

I'm going to address this and the gist of your anti-establishment argument along two lines:

1- Most of your proposed benefits base themselves on a presupposition of the inviolability of private property. Yet without an overarching structure to protect that private property, it is down to whatever capacity you have to defend it that preserves it. 

Where in the world there is least enforcement and state presence, property (and life) is in an incredibly precarious position. Historical evidence from the first recorded histories to the modern days supports this. From the endemic violence of the prehistoric era to the warlords of Afghanistan, the more tenuous the state's grasp on the monopoly of violence, the more widespread that violence is.

2- You also assume these solutions would be more efficient and better (this is what I assume by you using ""superior""). However, if we look at the Healthcare industry in the US, which is reasonably deregulated, healthcare cartels drive up costs and there is notable collusion between various agencies in that system that result in a lack of access and the driving up of costs for the consumers. Add to that the fact that despite the overwhelming privatization, the government is still spending a stupid amount on healthcare per person, most of it going to hospital and insurance companies without appreciable gains for the consumer.

Meanwhile, most of the better performing and accessible healthcare systems are single payer socialized systems. 

Without regulatory agencies, there is nothing to prevent monopolies on essential goods, resulting in a loss of efficiency. And we're not even getting into externalities (ie: pollution).

----------------------------

In sum, when evaluating any proposed political system, I find it always useful to use [Rawl's Veil of Ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance).

Would you be ready to be born in your system as a manual laborer whose home can at any time be ransacked by bandits, or who can be waylaid on the roads (who's building those by the way?) at any time, as frequently happened in lawless areas throughout history?

Are you also ready to forgo most of the comforts of modern life because you can't afford them, because the cost of setting up shop has gone drastically up due to security costs?

What about the internet? Might as well forget about net neutrality now that ISPs have no regulatory agencies above them.

And so it goes.

**I'd be remiss if I didn't mention you still haven't answered my question. You do not propose an alternative to the current system apart from mentioning what should be taken out of it. Yet you don't mention what you want to replace them by, and how, which was the core of my question.

Are you advocating for the destruction of countries, as in disregarding borders and seeing each individual as a sovereign entity? Are you arguing for a commune based lifestyle in which people freely associate or leave? Are for a broad federation of interests in which limited enforcement exists?

All of those alternatives (and more) can be argued from an anarchist standpoint, but what I've found when discussing with anarcho-communists or libertarians is that they're very light on details when it comes to the nitty gritty stuff of ""how it works"". This is something you do in this passage:

&gt;Some institutions may look capitalist (market-based) or socialist (voluntary pooled risk/resources.) Most anarchists favor one or the other to the exclusion of the other. I tend to favor market systems, but have no inherent objection to voluntary socialism or communism.

It again refers to my initial problem with your line of thinking. It stems from a presupposition that the rest of humanity is able or willing to follow your own ethics. The same as socialism, the entire thing falls apart as soon as someone doesn't play ball and is able to organize other humans into taking your stuff (and subjugating you).",False

Hours old accounts posting hateful content and taking a screenshot of it isn’t an example of it organically promoting hate. Literally everyone is welcome to support Trump. There is no discrimination in being proud to be an American and wanting a better future for yourself and future generations (or supporting what he supports from afar). If you don’t support him but still want to engage, that’s why they have askthe_donald. And that’s not to say someone who supports Trump has never been shitty, there are bad eggs in all camps. No racism is a strictly enforced rule, so pretending it should be removed for being “racist” is deliberately disingenuous.

The reason I ever found out about that sub in the first place is a common experience that unites many people who now actively lurk or participate; they were told it was a shitshow of disgusting people and they realized that it’s reality didn’t match what others had to say. People get curious, so they check it out on their own. Over time, people start to learn why it is slandered as much as it is and why establishment politicians are as threatened by Trump as they are. 

&gt; I mean, you sound like you share some of their perspectives like a belief in the idea that ""political correctness"" and ""identity politics"" are somehow threats

They are distinctly authoritarian tools used to give more power to the state through division and instilling chaos/fear, which is antithetical to the US Constitution.

&gt; It goes without saying that if you align enough with the beliefs of a group that they will generally treat you civilly and that otherwise they will not. 

No single person agrees 100% on anything. I’ve disagreed with people countless times civilly on that sub. Despite disparities, people are still united in supporting Trump. That doesn’t mean it’s blind worship, it’s picking your battles. That doesn’t happen in default subs, I’m either told to 1) fuck off back to the_donald 2) shadowbanned 3) banned or 4) followed and harassed via PM after a slurry of ad hominems.

&gt;  Why do your anecdotes regarding the civility and decency of that subreddit trump the anecdotes of users who claim the opposite? 

I am speaking from experience of actively participating there while others are speaking from what others have told them it is. Most people don’t like to go against the grain and fight for what they believe in, they’d rather follow the crowd so as to not be socially ostracized.

&gt; Why should I believe you over many other users?

Why believe someone who has been active there for years vs. someone who is informed second or third hand? Do you trust a restaurant from people who’ve never been but have just heard about it more than people that frequent it? What you choose to believe is  your prerogative, but the logical answer is glaringly simple. Peruse it yourself. You don’t have to agree with their general views to realize that it’s not a bastion of hatred, racism, sexism, etc. it’s falsely accused of being.

All the discussions regarding the conduct of T\_D? How much energy or effort have you put into examining what other subs or even journalists have written about T\_D? How many hours old does an account have to be or how long does that user have to be involved with T\_D to count towards the organic hate meter?   


""Literally everyone is welcome to support Trump. There is no discrimination in being proud to be an American and wanting a better future for yourself and future generations (or supporting what he supports from afar).""  


That statement adds nothing to your argument. There can be plenty of discrimination in being ""proud"" of ones nation depending on how that pride manifests materially. The community of T\_D are ""patriots"" who want a ""better"" future and therefore don't discriminate is just an empty sentiment and a useless bit of circular logic.  


""No racism is a strictly enforced rule, so pretending it should be removed for being “racist” is deliberately disingenuous.""     


They have a rule that racism is not allowed so it doesn't happen. Kind of like how making being a criminal a crime will eradicate crime, eh? Disingenuous is stating that something isn't a problem simply because there is a rule that prevents it from being a problem. Although this does make me wonder what you think discrimination and racism are.  


""... they were told it was a shitshow of disgusting people and they realized that it’s reality didn’t match what others had to say. People get curious, so they check it out on their own. Over time, people start to learn why it is slandered as much as it is and why establishment politicians are as threatened by Trump as they are.""  


I'll grant you that the way people often present their perspective on T\_D in a hyperbolic way, but that doesn't mean that the evidence and claims journalists and reddit users have made are false. It also hasn't been established that T\_D is slandered at all. That is what you are claiming is true from your perspective. Claiming that establishment politicians are threatened by Trump is also irrelevant to the discussion regarding the conduct of T\_D and is simply an opinion that isn't fact.  


""They are distinctly authoritarian tools used to give more power to the state through division and instilling chaos/fear, which is antithetical to the US Constitution.""  


By what mechanism? Who are the perpetrators?

They are often used to crush opposition from minorities when they try to challenge established discriminatory practices. They are an old trick in the right play book of smears.  


""No single person agrees 100% on anything. I’ve disagreed with people countless times civilly on that sub. Despite disparities, people are still united in supporting Trump.

Funny, I've had the same experiences when members of T\_D brigade more left subs. Save the banning of course, but the pm harassment is spot on. Civilly disagreeing with someone when you believe in the core tenants of a community is easy. After all, you do believe that ""There is no discrimination in being proud to be an American and wanting a better future for yourself and future generations..."". Did it occur to you that you have such a rosy picture of T\_D because you are their target user?  


""Most people don’t like to go against the grain and fight for what they believe in, they’d rather follow the crowd so as to not be socially ostracized.""  


Supporting Trump is not going against the grain. Try fighting for a worker's right to organize in a country where the word ""socialism"" is considered an evil buzzword by people who really don't know anything about. That is going against the grain. Again though, not relevant to this discussion.

I didn’t make that claim. I said that the majority of people who have the iconic “it promotes hate speech” view (the standard ‘racist, sexist, homophobic, fascist, etc.’ claims) don’t actually have their own experience there and have unwittingly adopted that interpretation from others who’ve been deliberately disingenuous about what it is for ulterior political motives. And many who do go there with false preexisting beliefs seek out behavior they believe is common, when it’s actually not.

&gt; What is organically promoting hate supposed to mean?

Seeing it commonly rather than an anomaly. A central rule rather than an exception. Something that seems to unite people there, when in reality the opposite is what unites people there. Love and respect for uniquely American (western) ideologies and values and strong contempt for postmodern, Marxist, and likeminded ideologies whose undergirding principle is rooted in division and master/slave or oppressor/oppressed dialectics.

&gt; That statement adds nothing to your argument

Except people falsely call it a place that promotes bigotry. In reality, anyone is welcome to share their support.

&gt; They have a rule that racism is not allowed so it doesn't happen. Kind of like how making being a criminal a crime will eradicate crime, eh

That’s why I said there are bad eggs in every group. A rule doesn’t eliminate the possibility, but the overwhelming majority of cases where there is an offending post, it’s by a burner account or someone who openly admits they want to “earn their ban”. By your logic, then, every subreddit would be subject to being shut down due to people breaking rules. Doesn’t make much sense to ban an entire community based on the bad actions of a few.

&gt; It also hasn't been established that T_D is slandered at all. That is what you are claiming is true from your perspective. 

There are chrome extensions for the expressed purpose of identifying people who’ve posted there. They are removed from the front page. Spez admitted to editing comments. If you make a post there you are automatically banned from several subreddits whether or not you’ve participated in them or even heard of them. Any time you post in a default sub, you’re accused of brigading. I am banned from default news subs for no reason (because I voiced dissent), and when I inquire why I was banned I am muted by the mods. Literally almost *any* time I ever post anywhere, there are at least 2 or 3 people that complain about post history just to participate in the anti-Trump circlejerk. 

&gt;  I'm from a progressive left position and when we see the words ""political correctness"" or ""identity politics"" they are generally bully terms used to silence voices airing legitimate concerns. They are often used to crush opposition from minorities when they try to challenge established discriminatory practices. They are an old trick in the right play book of smears.

Political correctness is disguising censorship as morality for political gain. Identity politics is deliberately segmenting the population and unnecessarily turning certain groups against others for the purposes of inciting chaos and fear for political gain. Authoritarianism is explicitly extreme leftist ideology while the extreme right is libertarian and ultimately anarchy. Neither extreme are good, but people pretending that the far-right is “fascist” is ignorant. Likewise, considering censorship and identity politics as a tool of the right who deeply covets the concept of inalienable liberty, forbearance rights/autonomy, and limited state is deeply ignorant.

&gt;  Did it occur to you that you have such a rosy picture of T_D because you are their target user?

There is no target user, and I lurked there long before I ever participated. I found the sub because they were at the top of all talking about sound dampeners being installed at the DNC convention and Bernie protestors being fenced out. Ask other redditors with integrity, people remember default politics subs being organically anti-Hillary and overwhelmingly pro-Bernie until it basically flipped overnight. Why is that? Some of the most active people in the_donald are ex-Bernie supporters who have been forced out of default subs because anything short of shilling for Hillary seems you a neo-Nazi. 

&gt; Supporting Trump is not going against the grain. Try fighting for a worker's right to organize in a country where the word ""socialism"" is considered an evil buzzword by people who really don't know anything about. That is going against the grain. Again though, not relevant to this discussion.

The left likes to pretend that people who despise the concept of socialism are all uneducated rednecks whose concept of socialism is borne out of Glen Beck commentary. In reality, socialism is fiercely rejected by many who have studied incalculable examples of it leading to murderous, disgusting totalitarian regimes that have left some of the darkest stains on human history. The left likes to pretend somehow that Nazi Germany was “far right” when in reality the party gained its initial support specifically because it included socialist in its name for the purposes of being deceptively alluring. Not because it was socialist or because Hitler was a socialist, he later publicly said he despised socialism, but used it because it gave him a stronger base that later perverted itself into the travesty it became. Not a single socialist country has ever been successful, and that includes the overwhelmingly white European democratic socialist countries people like to tout as examples whose defense is largely paid by the US taxpayer. Socialism is not evil in and of itself, it’s a tool used by the corrupt to gain more power under the nebulous concept of “the common good”.

Let’s assume your claim is valid, so you’re arguing they should be banned because some people have misused definitions in your view? Ignoring the fact that you seem to be the one who is confused about the actual definitions of those terms, if you are honest with yourself you would take issue with the vitriol in all political subs, not just ones that you personally disagree with. The amount of seething hatred and groupthink in default subs is notoriously toxic and if you can’t find issue with that then you might consider that you don’t actually care about promoting a safer environment, but really you are fine with the practice of silencing others with whom you disagree. Aka, complicit in censorship and being a political pawn for tech conglomerates working at the behest of corrupt politicians while mindlessly LARPing as an intellectual egalitarian anti-capitalist.

I'm already grateful, and I'll be happily content caring on in the same way indefinitely. 

We're financially comfortable, like having nice shit, traveling, enjoying the occasional boozy weekend.  We have 11 nieces and nephews, but all of our friends/family with kids are all on the verge of divorce and/or dont have sex anymore.  Not exactly appealing. We just had the foresight of being smart enough to use protection when we were kids, not get knocked up, and had the time to realize children rearing sucks. 

 If you want a basic miserable life, cool bruh.  But why do you want kids while destroying the planet and setting your hopeful fuck trophies up in the shit society you're inevitably working towards?  Aren't parents supposed to want the best for your kids?  I hope you don't want a daughter.  Yeesh.  Your children are absolutely going to hate and resent you and the life you gave them.

I'm not socially and environmentally conscientious, because I care one way or another about the planet after I die. I'll be dead, without wasting resources on crotch fruit, hopefully on a boozy weekend or during a senior citizen PC lan party dungeon raid at a nursing home.  It seems the reason I demonstrate the bare minimumrespect to my surroundings and strangers is likely due to the fact that my parents just actually loved me enough to put in the effort of not raising a shitty idiot. 

Nevertheless, if you're lucky enough to actually entrap and knock up a woman then, when automation takes over the majority of the workforce, and owning any of the sinking land becomes unrealistically expensive for the majority of society, own the hand you delt. Don't be a coward and deny your support of destroying the only planet your grandchildren can live on.  Look them through their eyeballs and right into their dead souls, and tell them that you knew and didn't give a fuck about them or their future.  That shit is fucking hilarious.

You must be a fucking sociopath.  I'll never understand the level of narcissism necessary to want to bring children into this shit fest.  But then to do it, and then support policies that directly fuck up their lives.  They might even die young and painfully, and you are directly cheering it on.

However these lines have been blurred for years and it isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Some publishers play the role of platform with things like editorials, blog posts and comments.  Platforms of course edit and curate some content as they find it necessary as we are discussing here.


So of course the problem is why do they curate content?  At the end of the day they have their core userbase, a corporate image to maintain and of course financial responsibilities.  Since the majority of revenue is ad based they have no choice but to listen to advertisers.  Is it an issue that these platforms don't allow pornography?  It's no different than with Alex Jones.  I mean, if youporn or something could push sample content on Facebook I imagine it would generate a ton of extra clicks for them.  Nobody seems sad they're relegated to their own infrastructure.  You need to work with specific advertisers to make money off porn, your mainstream advertisers won't be interested at all anymore once porn is involved.  Pretty simple stuff.


As for why Alex Jones was banned around the same time?  Hard to say, my best guess is it came down to a large umbrella corporation that owns many different advertisers that utilize the platforms had an issue with his recent Sandy Hook nonsense.  They threatened to pull ads from all platforms supporting him, thus it looks like they all conspired to ban him.  If we're looking for the simplest most common sense reasoning that requires no mental gymnastics that would be it.

The US choosing to not trade with someone also doesn't mean it's at fault. You can't demand the US trade with everyone on everyone else's terms. Some of those sanctions are to punish governments that hurt their own people, by the fucking way.""

When the Chinese government attempted to crack down on the flow of opium into their country do you know what Western nations did? They used force to maintain the opium trade. Although, I love how you brush off Western nations funneling opium into China as innocent trade, but in nearly the same breath state that sanctions are to punish the bad governments. Sanctions on bad governments is good (even though it punishes the populace more), but the Chinese government trying to stop Western drug pushers is bad. By the fucking way, if you honestly believe that sanctions are put in place to ultimately help the people of the countries that they target then I have a bridge in the Sahara to sell you. 

""What happened to the indigenous people of North America was tragic, but A) they were fighting and slaughtering each other long before Europeans arrived and B) the deaths the United States caused in Native American communities don't touch the amount of people killed by communism, and the US is a very different country today.""

Holy fuck. Really? You are so concerned about all those tragic deaths under communism, but you hand wave away a literal attempt at genocide because indigenous communities had armed conflict, commies are bad, and America isn't that way anymore?

I guess we can excuse the deaths under communism because the all the different populations that lived under the USSR all had armed conflicts before the Bolshevik Revolution, right? 

As for point B. Let us pop a neat little thought experiment here. Let us say that someone kidnaps your mother, forces her to speak a new language under threat of violence, rapes her, and does all sorts of horrible things to her that ultimately leads to them murdering her. Now lets say that someone goes off and kills 24 people in a cold blooded mass shooting. How would you feel if the media and people in general brushed off your mother's death and mistreatment as ""tragic"", but not nearly as bad as that mass shooting because she was only one person who was murdered compared to twenty four people. Then people packed up and did almost nothing to address your mother's death. Would you feel the same way about that as you do about attempted indigenous genocide perpetrated by America?

As for the claim that America is a different nation today, well, I just don't think you've been paying attention. Secret prisons, extra judicial killing of foreign nationals, support of Saudi proxy wars, and so on and so on.

""Vietnam was not our finest moment, that's fair enough.""

That is all you have to say? So you care so deeply for all the deaths caused by communism, but the death and trauma caused by America in Vietnam gets the equivalent of a ""meh""? 

""However, the death tolls there also don't touch communism. Furthermore, you can blame France and communist influences for that shit show too.""

First, I'd love to see what figures you are working with and where you got them. There is a ton of misinformation regarding the death tolls and the circumstances surrounding them. That really isn't the important thing here. The important thing here is how you are demanding that communism as a whole (when it did achieve a lot of good too) be roundly condemned all the time on the basis that it killed more people than other ideologies.

Yes. Its strident anti-Trump rhetoric is not ideological; it is entirely about the preservation of establishment norms, of decorum, of bipartisan comity.

So let’s say we have two statements: statement A, “We as a society should literally kill everyone with brown eyes because they are subhuman,” and statement B, “if you have brown eyes, you should listen to every Nickelback album.” (For reference, I have brown eyes).

Statement B I don’t find particularly offensive, I just disagree with it on the grounds that Nickelback is a band that doesn’t fit my aesthetic preferences. I’m not really harmed by such a statement, and wouldn’t even suffer much harm if the statement were actualized. On the other hand, we have statement A. Now, I don’t actually find find statement A particularly offensive, but let’s suppose that in the past, brown-eyed people have been systematically mistreated (e.g. genocided, denied rights, consistently socially stigmatized, whatever) in many countries in the world, including the one I live in. If that were the case, I probably would feel offended, in that Statement A would constitute a threat against my continued existence, as well as a speech act that seems to unfairly single me (and others like me) out and ascribe to me negative qualities. In a hypothetical society like the one I specified, statement A would actually be somewhat dangerous to me if left unchallenged, as it’s plausible that others might see it and try to act on it. And even if most people didn’t feel the need to act on it, even if they disagreed with it, repeating statements like statement A around them often enough might lead them to disregard its meaning and intent, until they were complacent about others adopting the idea behind statement A, perhaps even ultimately becoming complacent enough to allow others to act on statement A without protest. 

In this case, it would seem to be a mischaracterization to say that I “dislike” or “disagree with” statement A in the same way that I dislike and disagree with statement B, in that statement A both does an immediate harm to me by challenging my status as a person, and poses a danger to my continued existence. It’s therefore not just a matter of preference for me to oppose statement A (either by protesting against it or by attempting to silence people who make statements like it). Rather, it’s potentially necessary for my continued existence to oppose it (and under most moral systems, a moral necessity to oppose similar statements directed at others, but I’ve been typing for long enough and would rather not go into that).  Further, given the way genetics and relationship formation work, I would likely have many friends, family, and loved ones with brown eyes, so my opposition wouldn’t even be purely self-interested, but instead would also ultimately be a defense of others I care about. 

Now, obviously you could boil all that down to preference—e.g. “you merely prefer that you and your loved ones continue to live” but this seems to be a qualitatively different *kind* of preference compared to mundane preferences like, say, what kind of music I want to listen to. Similarly, you could construe violation of my mundane preferences as “harmful” but again, this seems to be a very different kind of harm than that implied by statement A.

They aired his rallies uninterrupted and live for most of the campaign, and maybe the entire campaign. They only started tepidly fact-checking him in the final months.

&gt; while downplaying Hillary's lies 

Every study of the 2015-2016 media coverage of the election I've seen indicates that they spent an inordinate amount of time focusing on her emails and Benghazi, which I'm sure to you mean ""Hillary's lies."" Hillary started the campaign out polling basically even on favorability; she ended it as the second-most unpopular major-party Presidential nominee since the advent of polling. Nothing about her as a person changed; the way the media covered her certainly did.

Take a look at how their respective fave/unfave ratings chart over the course of the race. [For Trump](https://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/donald-trump-favorable-rating), he started out at 20% favorable, 67% unfavorable, but the day before the election, he was at 40% favorable, 57% unfavorable. His favorable rating had doubled and his unfavorable rating had gone down by 10 points. Again, as with Hillary, little to nothing about the man himself had changed; but the media coverage had a clear and positive impact.

Meanwhile, let's take Hillary's numbers at the same starting point: June of 2015. At that time, she was at 46% favorable, 48% unfavorable. Already, media coverage of her was taking a toll. The [chart here](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/hillary-clinton-favorable-rating) is very instructive. Her numbers start taking a dive almost immediately after Obama's re-election; that coincides with when coverage of her shifted from ""Secretary of State Hillary Clinton"" to ""prospective Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton."" It also coincides with when coverage of Benghazi started. By the time of the election, her numbers were 34% favorable, 54% unfavorable--farther underwater than Trump, with a lower favorable rating and almost the same unfavorable rating.

So when I look at a campaign in which one candidate started out 47 points underwater and ended up 17 points underwater, and another candidate started out two points underwater and ended up 20 points underwater, it sure looks to me like the media coverage was relatively friendly to the first candidate and relatively unfriendly to the second.

&gt; They believe they are suffering from systemic violence and racism, by the state. They don't use the exact words, but that's basically ""police are targeting us."" There's a reason most of their news coverage comes from protests of cops shooting black people - because that's by and large when they're most active. It's their raison d'etre. 

You've come so close to grasping their concern, and yet somehow it eludes you. The operative word in that first sentence is *systemic*. Systemic racism does not require every individual cop to be ""out to shoot every black person they see."" It does not even require *any* individual cop to be out to shoot every black person they see. The objections of BLM to the state of law enforcement in this country are not about whether all, most, or even a lot of police officers are active, overt, conscious racists with a thirst for blood. The objections are to a system which has been set up to put black people at an extreme disadvantage, to police them and punish them at disproportionate rates, to vilify them to such an extent that police officers are conditioned to fear for their lives upon seeing a black person, and to instill a complete lack of accountability in police departments. Those are grievances aimed at systems, not individuals; the movement is not built upon calling all cops murderers. But the pro-life movement is explicitly built on calling abortion doctors murderers.",False

We know of the damage because we have statistical data from societies and cultures that practice it versus those that value free speech, and we know the types of people it targets because we can see which people complain about being censored.

The other error is your last sentence where you claim my proposed solution is no longer viable.  My proposed solution is absolutely still viable.  Do not quarantine communities, and do not remove posts.  That is totally within reddit's capabilities.

&gt; Allowing people like t_d users to spread misinformation and radicalize people with impunity normalizes that behavior.

That is true, which is why free speech is so important.  If you were allowed to respond to and rebuff their nonsense at every turn, they would be forced to engage with you, or at least have your argument continually thrown at them.  When you censor them, you force them to create their own community and isolate themselves and strengthen their echo chamber even further.  By not being able to refute them, you rob yourself of the possibility to change their mind, and ensure that their behavior and beliefs do not change.

&gt; This isn't quashing dissent, this isn't persecuting people for having different opinions, this isn't ""le libtard leftists censoring muh free speech"" - this is preventing extremists from radicalizing others to bolster their numbers. Giving them a platform with which to spread their propaganda.

You are wrong.  The answer to bad ideas spreading is to refute them.  Blocking them from being spoken does not change their mind, and it robs the rest of the world the ability to hear their *and your* views, and decide for themselves which arguments are sound.

In short, the censor proclaims himself the moral authority to be the arbiter of what is acceptable thought and what is not.  You may find that appropriate when you find the thoughts of places like t_d to be so repugnant, but it is not appropriate.  It is not your, nor anybody's, moral right to decide what views other people are allowed to consider.  By censoring them, you not only entrench them and deny the ability to change them, you also declare yourself the moral authority on thought.  And that simply is not your right.

&gt; If this were about censoring free speech, then subs like /r/conservative and /r/libertarian would've been quarantined/banned as well, but they weren't, because they aren't bigoted cesspools like t_d or the subs that the reddit admins actually take action against - and I'm saying that as a gigantic liberal SJW socialist cuck.

&gt;The fact that conservatism at large isn't banned on reddit is not remotely some kind of proof that reddit doesn't engage in censorship.

Are you aware that there is a huge fundamental difference between shutting down a subreddit because its users routinely break the rules of the site, and censoring someone purely for their opinions?

reddit **is** banning subs whose users routinely break the rules of the site &amp; the laws of the land (everything from doxxing and brigading to death threats) and the mods do **nothing**.

Your claim (and the claim of so many other conservatives and libertarians) is that reddit is censoring anyone who isn't a leftist, socialist, liberal, democrat, marxist, or any other label typically associated with anyone left of center. The fact that they allow subs that dissent so long as they remain respectful of the site's rules (which is a pretty reasonable expectation), proves that claim false.


&gt;The answer to bad ideas spreading is to refute them. Blocking them from being spoken does not change their mind, and it robs the rest of the world the ability to hear their and your views, and decide for themselves which arguments are sound.

You can't argue with people in a bubble, you just can't. If I were to go to t_d and they were to allow me to try to refute the claims there, I would get downvoted to hell, and my comment would be buried under so much shit that the only t_d users who would see it would be people actively searching for dissenters to further ridicule them. The same goes for left-leaning subs like /r/latestagecapitalism - even though I'm pretty close to considering myself a socialist, I don't participate in that sub or even regularly browse it. It's not a sub for healthy debate, and if it were ever to devolve into a radical cesspit of death threats and doxxing like t_d or the subs that reddit admins actually take action against, I would be in favor of it's removal/quarantine.

These subs actively quash dissent, making it impossible to refute anything in them. Only middleground subs that don't have any specific affiliations do you ever see actual conversations about politics that go beyond ""FUCKING LIBTARD CUCKS"" and ""EAT THE 1%""

&gt;You may find that appropriate when you find the thoughts of places like t_d to be so repugnant, but it is not appropriate. It is not your, nor anybody's, moral right to decide what views other people are allowed to consider.

Banning rulebreakers =/= censoring free speech. If Jim Bob doesn't like black people, then he's a bigot, but he's entitled to his opinion. If Jim Bob decides to start assaulting black people, that's no longer free speech. You're also neglecting the fact that subs like t_d actively push **false information** and **foreign propaganda**.",False

Their motivations are not at issue here. They aired his rallies uninterrupted and without commentary; that's not something that any candidate for any office gets in this day and age. Also not at issue is whether they were ""supporting"" him. What is at issue is that they were not trying to do a hatchet job on him. They treated him as a serious candidate long before they actually believed he was a serious candidate. Contrast their treatment of him with their treatment of Bernie; not a lot of coverage until he won New Hampshire. And--as a former field staffer for his campaign--I thought that was appropriate. An insurgent/longshot candidate does have to earn coverage. Otherwise the media would have to treat Vermin Supreme as a legitimate candidate. But Trump didn't have to earn it. He got it right from the start.

&gt; it would probably have been a disservice to do the same for Hillary since she had nowhere near the energy Trump does, she could never draw the same kinds of crowds. 

Reasonable people can disagree on this point, but I don't think the crowds were the reason those rallies had an impact. It was that his ideas--many of which were until recently considered either disgusting or stupid by the mainstream of American society, not just ""elites""--were given the imprimatur of the establishment political media. If CNN is putting this guy on the air, that must mean he's not a wackjob, therefore his ideas must be within the scope of acceptable discussion, therefore I should listen to them with an open mind.

&gt; Did it? Can you prove the media coverage was responsible for that change in a significant way? 

It's not the only factor, and I'm open to being proven wrong, but what other factors are there? Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton didn't change over the course of those 16 months. Their beliefs didn't change. Their platforms changed only marginally, if at all.

What did change? The coverage around Hillary Clinton began to center on themes of corruption, her being out of touch, Benghazi, her emails, etc. The coverage around Donald Trump was also generally negative, but always interspersed with breathless stories about HOW IS HE DOING THIS???? POLITICAL SAVANT??? and his supposed skill at communicating with the working class (most of which didn't actually vote for him in the end.) In simplified terms, Hillary was cast as the out of touch Washington insider, and Trump was cast as the bull in a china shop who wasn't afraid to break things. One of those narratives paints a clearly negative picture; the other is one that plenty of people in America could get behind.

And even if you think both of those narratives are true, and that the media was just calling balls and strikes, the question, going back a few comments upthread, is whether CNN has been attacking Trump from the word go, and whether or not their objection to him is ideological. And I think the evidence suggests that the answer to both is no.

&gt; His approval rating [hasn't exactly been tanking](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/trump_favorableunfavorable-5493.html) since the MSM put a target on his back, either.  

Probably because their attacks are informed by centrism, and no one in America is centrist! The loudest anti-Trump voices are the ones with the least to say about how he has impacted this country.

&gt; Perhaps his rating has very little to do with how the media portrays him, because he constantly tells his supporters they're 'fake news'. 

In this day and age, it is probably almost impossible for a sitting President to have an approval rating below 35, yes. But by that same token, he should be able to reach the mid-60s before he runs into the opposite end of diminishing returns. Something is affecting those ratings.

&gt; and yet they march on a case-by-case basis.

1) Just because you only notice their protests when they occur in proximity to a cop killing an unarmed black person doesn't mean that's the only time they protest.

2) Of course the system is unfair. The word of a police officer is taken as if it were documentary evidence. That's a fundamentally unfair system.",False

For one, maybe that subreddits has problems beyond what we know about. Are you a mod there? Do you know the culture and what was being discussed or talked about on the reg?

If I owned this company, I would never let someone host their forum for ideas like that, in my space. It's bad for business, bad for PR, bad for everything. This isn't a thought police issue. People can still damn well find whatever they want. Anyone who disagrees with this is likely not aware of how the internet actually fucking works.

Clearly, it's not that the red pill is a hate subreddit, because they would just ban it as they clearly want to. BUT, they absolutely hate the red pill ideas so they quarantine them and conveniently post a site to brainwash them into correctThink.

That sounds scary to me. Sure reddit is a private company, but how many big private companies are there anyway?

Let's see:

* reddit
* facebook
* twitter
* snapchat
* instagram
* whatsapp

Well idk more, but insagram and whatsapp are owned by facebook, so those 3 are 1.

Say there's 5x more of them or so. Maybe 30 top websites where you can actually shout to a lot of people. Those 30 are probably owned by 15 or less companies. 

So all it takes is for those 15 companies to not like your opinion and you are pretty much completely censored. 

You could go to more niche platforms.. but those platforms are only probably occupied by people with niche views. So you're effectively stopped from trying to change anyone's mind.

In other words, most people could easily enter an echo chamber at best, brainwashed by the companies at worst. 

The first step is getting people on board with banning ""hate speech"". Then as soon as that's done, people will cry to ban other things cus ""it's not fair my thing was banned when this thing is hateful too!""

The fact that they allow subs that dissent so long as they remain respectful of the site's rules (which is a pretty reasonable expectation), proves that claim false.

I have made no such claim.  I am not talking about reddit's specific types of censorship.  I am talking about the dangers of censorship generally -- ANY censorship.  Including but not limited to reddit's.

Your injecting your own politics into this discussion.  This isn't about how much censorship reddit is doing or to whom, this is my arguing any and all censorship is wrong, and why.  Yes, more of it is worse than less of it, but censorship of all kinds is wrong.  And it is incorrect to claim reddit is doing no censorship.  They are doing some -- you may view that amount as appropriate, but you can't deny that it is indeed happening.

&gt; You can't argue with people in a bubble, you just can't. If I were to go to t_d and they were to allow me to try to refute the claims there, I would get downvoted to hell, and my comment would be buried under so much shit that the only t_d users who would see it would be people actively searching for dissenters to further ridicule them.

Yet you claim that them denying you to speak at all, or you denying them to speak, would somehow *lessen that echo chamber bubble*!?

That's my point.  Whatever negative result you get from attempting to have a discourse with them, it's just as bad or worse to have no discourse at all.  And the only way to guarantee no discourse occurs is censorship.  That's one of many reasons I claim all censorship is wrong.

&gt; These subs actively quash dissent, making it impossible to refute anything in them.

I agree that that is the case, and I agree that it is wrong.  So why do you figure that you and reddit also quashing dissent is the solution?

&gt; Banning rulebreakers =/= censoring free speech.

Sure it is, if the rules are rules about what is acceptable speech.

&gt; If Jim Bob doesn't like black people, then he's a bigot, but he's entitled to his opinion. If Jim Bob decides to start assaulting black people, that's no longer free speech.

That's a true statement, but I've never seen anybody reach through my screen on reddit and assault me.  It's a computer screen, you don't have to look at it.  If there's something hurtful displayed on it, you can turn it off or look somewhere else.

&gt; You're also neglecting the fact that subs like t_d actively push **false information** and **foreign propaganda**.

I am not at all neglecting that.  It's absolutely true and it's reprehensible.  My claim is that the proper solution to that is to publicly refute it, not prevent them from doing it.  That way, when others hear their speech, they've already heard your rebuttal and know their speech is bullshit.  By censoring them, you merely ensure that they never hear opposing views and that anybody who finds their way to them is more easy lured in and indoctrinated.  More speech is the answer to bad free speech.  Censorship is not right, nor effective.
